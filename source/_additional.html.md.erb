# Formatting

To set or read formatting programmatically, Smartsheet uses a compact format string, **cell.format**, which looks something like this: `",,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,"`. The position and sample values in this string are explained in the following format descriptor table:

## Format Descriptor Table

**Position** | **Lookup Property** | **Example Value** | **Format String**
-----|-----|-----|-----|
0 | fontFamily | 0 = Arial, default | `"0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"`
1 | fontSize | 0 = 8 pt, default | `",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"`
2 | bold | 1 = on | `",,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,"`
3 | italic | 1 = on | `",,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,"`
4 | underline | 1 = on | `",,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,"`
5 | strikethrough | 1 = on | `",,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,"`
6 | horizontalAlign | 2 = center | `",,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,"`
7 | verticalAlign | 2 = middle | `",,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,"`
8 | color (text) | 4 = #FEEEF0 | `",,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,"`
9 | color (background) | 8 = #E6F5FE | `",,,,,,,,,8,,,,,,"` 
10 | color (taskbar) | 9 = #F3E5FA | `",,,,,,,,,,9,,,,,"`
11 | currency | 13 = USD | `",,,,,,,,,,,13,,,,"`
12 | decimalCount | 3 = three decimal places | `",,,,,,,,,,,,3,,,"`
13 | thousandsSeparator | 1 = on | `",,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,"`
14 | numberFormat | 2 = currency | `",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"`
15 | textWrap | 1 = on | `",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1"`

<aside class="notice">Formats that have not been explicitly set are omitted in the descriptor string. For example, a cell that has been set to bold and italic, but has no other formats applied to it, has a format descriptor of <code>",,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,"</code>.</aside>

<aside class="notice">Use <b>GET /serverinfo</b> to return the <a href="#formattables-object">FormatTables Object</a>, which tells you both the default settings and what formatting options are available.</aside>

**defaults** | A format descriptor where each element describes the formats the Smartsheet Web app displays for format values that have not been set.
**fontFamily** | Font families with additional font information
**fontSize** | Font sizes in points
**bold** | Possible values:<ul><li>none</li><li>on</li></ul>

**horizontalAlign** | Horizontal alignment, possible values:<ul><li>default</li><li>left</li><li>center</li><li>right</li></ul>Note: "default" is the default value, which is equivalent to "left".
**verticalAlign** | Vertical alignment, possible values:<ul><li>default</li><li>top</li><li>middle</li><li>bottom</li></ul>Note: "default" is the default value, which is equivalent to "top".
**color** | Color hex values. <br/><br/>Note: "none" is the default value for all colors.  Applications must handle this value and use app-defined colors (typically this is Black for text color and White for background color)

<aside class="notice">Indexes and their values are guaranteed never to change or be removed for a given major API version.  However, new values could potentially be added to the ends of lookup tables.<br/><br/>Because of this possibility, your code should handle the case where a cell might contain a format index value greater than the size of a lookup table your app has loaded.  Your application should check for that case and reload the format tables if necessary.</aside>

### FontFamily Object

> Example FontFamily Object:

```json
{
  "fontFamily": [{
    "name": "Arial",
      "traits": [
        "sans-serif"
    ]
  }]
}
```

     |     |     |
-----|-----|-----|
**name** | string | Name of the font family (for example, "Arial")
**traits** | array | Platform-independent traits of the font family. One of the following values:<ul><li>serif</li><li>sans-serif</li>

### Currency Object

> Example Currency Object:

```json
{
	"currency": [{
		"code": "USD",
		"symbol": "$"
	}]
}
```

     |     |     |
-----|-----|-----|
**code** | string | The [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) currency code (for example, "EUR")
**symbol** | string | The currency symbol (for example, "€")

## Get Formatting

Use the "include=format" query-string parameter on API operations that return detailed objects, such as `GET /sheets/{sheetId}` or `GET sheets/{sheetId}/rows/{rowId}`. If there is formatting other than default settings, the return includes a **format** property. If an object has conditional formatting, the **format** property returned will have a **conditionalFormat** value.

## Set Formatting for a Row or Column

Setting the format of a row object or column object through the API simply sets the baseline format for new or blank cells in that row or column.  It does not affect cells that already have a value.
 
If you want to change the formatting of cells that already have content, for instance you want to make a row bold, then you have to set the format for each cell individually.

# Troubleshooting

Should you encounter issues with the Smartsheet API while building an integration using a particular programming language (ex: Java, C#, PHP, Python, etc.), keep the following troubleshooting techniques in mind.

1. Try executing the same API Request using a tool like [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/). By taking your code out of the equation, you can isolate troubleshooting to the raw Request / Response.
  * If you receive a similar error when you execute the Request using cURL or Postman, this suggests an issue with the Request format or contents. Once you have the Request working in cURL or Postman, update your code accordingly.
  * If you can execute the Request successfully using cURL or Postman, but not via your code, this suggests that the Request your code is sending is somehow different than what you intend. Compare the (successful) Request from cURL or Postman with the (unsuccessful) Request that your code generates. (See step #2 below.)
2. Examine the Request that your code is sending (including the HTTP verb, URI, headers, and Request body) and the Response that it's receiving back from Smartsheet (including the HTTP status code, headers, and response body).
  * If you've implemented Request / Response logging in your application, inspect the full trace of Request and Response in the log file. Compare the Request that your application is logging with the (successful) Request from cURL or Postman, and update your code to correct any discrepancies.
  * Alternatively, you may choose to use a tool like [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) or [Charles HTTP Proxy](https://www.charlesproxy.com/) to inspect the full trace of Request and Response as it goes across the wire. Compare the Request trace that your application generates with the (successful) Request from cURL or Postman, and update your code to correct any discrepancies.
3. Check for capitalization errors. Note that URL endpoints are all lower case, while object properties and query parameters are camelCase.
