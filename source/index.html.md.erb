# Overview

## Introduction

> **Base URL**:  https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0

The Smartsheet API provides programmatic access to Smartsheet features and data. 
In designing the API, our goal was to make it simple, intuitive, and predictable. 
We do our best to adhere to common open and widely accepted standards, including REST for access, JSON format for the data, and OAuth for Authentication and Authorization. 
This API assumes a good working knowledge of the Smartsheet application UI, concepts and terminology.

## RESTful Architecture

```apires
Resources:

/contacts
/favorites
/folders
/groups
/home
/reports
/search
/serverinfo
/sheets
/sheets/{id}/rows
/sheets/{id}/columns
/sheets/{id}/attachments
/sheets/{id}/discussions
/sheets/{id}/updaterequests
/templates
/token
/users
/users/{id}/alternateemails
/workspaces
```

Everything in Smartsheet is represented as an object with a defined structure. 
For example, the "Home" object contains a list of your Sheets, Folders, Reports, Templates, and Workspaces, and a Sheet object contains Columns, Rows, Attachments, and Discussions. 
All aspects of Smartsheet are modeled as structured objects.

URL structure follows typical resource-oriented conventions. For example, to get a list of sheets, use `GET https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets`. 
This will return a list of Sheet objects, where each Sheet will have an "id" attribute. 
To get details on a particular sheet, use `GET https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/123456`, where 123456 is the "id" of the Sheet you want. 
Similarly, to share a sheet, `POST` a Share object to `https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/123456/shares`.

## HTTP Standards

All actions taken through the API are done via HTTP using [standard HTTP methods](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html): GET (to retrieve an object), POST (to create), PUT (to modify), and DELETE. 
[Standard HTTP Response codes](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html) are used to indicate success and error conditions.

## Input / Output Format

Unless otherwise specified, all API endpoints expect request body data to be in [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON), and the response body data is returned as JSON.
The following HTTP request headers may be required, depending on the operation and endpoint being invoked:

     |     |
-----|-----|
*Content-Type* | For POST and PUT requests, must be set to the appropriate value (typically `application/json`).  Ignored for GET and DELETE requests.
*Accept*       | Optional; if not specified, `*/*` is assumed (i.e. any response type is accepted), else it must match the output of the invoked endpoint (typically `application/json`).
 
<aside class="notice">Some of the data returned by the Smartsheet API is user-generated content. Caution should be taken to ensure that the user-generated content is consumed safely in any external system to avoid introducing vulnerabilities.</aside>

## Example Requests & Responses

For every API operation in this documentation, we show example requests in multiple languages and an example (JSON) response. 
You'll see the examples displayed in the dark blue panel next to each operation. 
To view the sample code in a specific language, select the corresponding language tab along the top of the dark blue panel. 
For more information about using the sample code in this API documentation, see [SDKs and Sample Code](#sdks-and-sample-code). 

As with any REST API, you can also test API requests / responses using a Chrome extension like [Advanced REST Client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo/) or [POSTMAN](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm). 

## Versioning and Changes

**Non-breaking changes**: We will be adding new functionality and bug fixes to the API over time. 
You should expect to see new endpoints or new attributes for existing objects. 
Such changes will not result in a new API version.  Please make sure that your code can handle new attributes gracefully. 
Also, please make sure your code does not depend on the order in which records are returned, unless it is explicitly stated in this documentation. 
Finally, please be aware that a request which results in an Error response today (because the requested action is prohibited in Smartsheet) may succeed in the future, if Smartsheet functionality changes such that the previously prohibited action becomes allowed. 

**Breaking changes**: We intend to maintain the current API version for the foreseeable future. 
If and when we decide to add functionality that breaks the contract of the current API, we will publish it with a new version number, so as to keep the existing API functionality backwards compatible.

**Deprecations**: Smartsheet occasionally deprecates APIs to indicate that those APIs should no longer be used in active development. 
Deprecated APIs typically remain present and usable for a reasonable period of time following the release in which they were deprecated, but may be removed entirely from a future version of the API. 
You should never use deprecated APIs in new development, and if you have existing code that uses deprecated APIs, we recommend that you update that code as soon as possible. 
For a list of Smartsheet API 2.0 deprecations, see [Deprecations](#deprecations).

# API Fundamentals

## API Best Practices

We strongly recommend that you design your integration with the following guidelines in mind:

* **Be efficient**: Use "bulk"-enabled operations
* **Be practical**: Adhere to rate limiting guidelines
* **Be smart**: Handle errors appropriately
* **Be diligent**: Implement logging

<br/>
<span class="inSectionSubheading">Be efficient: Use "bulk"-enabled operations</span>

For maximum efficiency, we recommend that you use bulk-enabled API operations whenever possible. 
A bulk-enabled API operation allows you to add, update, or delete multiple items using a single API request. 
For example, if you need to update 10 rows within a sheet, do so using a single [Update Row(s)](#update-row(s)) request, rather than executing 10 separate requests - one for each row.

Bulk-enabled operations improve efficiency by:

* Dramatically reducing the number of outbound calls you have to make
* Reducing your chances of hitting the [rate limit](#rate-limiting) (since each bulk operation counts as only one request toward the limit)
* Lightening the load on our systems, making your requests more likely to complete in a timely manner

See the section on [Bulk Operations](#bulk-operations) for more details, including a list of bulk-enabled operations.

<br/>
<span class="inSectionSubheading">Be practical: Adhere to rate limiting guidelines</span>

<%= partial "snippets/rateLimiting.md.erb" %>

<br/>
<span class="inSectionSubheading">Be smart: Handle errors appropriately</span>

<%= partial "snippets/errorHandling.md.erb" %>

<br/>
<span class="inSectionSubheading">Be diligent: Implement logging</span>

We strongly recommend that you design your integration such that it is capable of logging API requests and responses. 
Having access to the raw requests and responses (including detailed error codes and error messages) when API issues emerge will streamline troubleshooting and accelerate time to resolution.

The following examples show the type of information that your application should log for API requests and responses.

**Request:  verb, URI, header(s), request body**

`POST https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/4098273196697476/columns`<br/> 
`Authorization: Bearer MY_TOKEN`<br/>
`Content-Type: application/json`<br/>
`[`<br/>
&#160;&#160;`{`<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;`"title": "FIRST COLUMN - My New Column",`<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;`"index": 0,`<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;`"type": "TEXT_NUMBER"`<br/>
&#160;&#160;`},`<br/>
&#160;&#160;`{`<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;`"title": "FIRST COLUMN - My New Column",`<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;`"index": 1,`<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;`"type": "TEXT_NUMBER"`<br/>
&#160;&#160;`}`<br/>
`]`

**Response:  HTTP status code, response body**

`HTTP status: 400 Bad Request`<br/>
`{`<br/>
&#160;&#160;`"errorCode": 1133,`<br/>
&#160;&#160;`"message": "Column titles are not unique among input columns.",`<br/>
&#160;&#160;`"detail": { "columnTitle": "FIRST COLUMN - My New Column" }`<br/>
`}`

## API Troubleshooting

Should you encounter issues with the Smartsheet API while building an integration using a particular programming language (ex: Java, C#, PHP, Python, etc.), keep the following troubleshooting techniques in mind.

<ol>
	<li>
		<b>Try executing the same API Request using a tool like <a href="#testing-with-curl">cURL</a> or <a href="#testing-with-postman">Postman</a>.</b> By taking your code out of the equation, you can isolate troubleshooting to the raw Request / Response.<br/><br/>
		<ul>
			<li>If you receive a similar error when you execute the Request using cURL or Postman, this suggests an issue with the Request format or contents. Consult the <a href="http://smartsheet-platform.github.io/api-docs" target="_blank">API Documentation</a> to ensure that the Request being sent matches what the documentation specifies. Once you have the Request working in cURL or Postman, update your code accordingly.<br/><br/></li>
			<li>If you're able to execute the Request successfully using cURL or Postman, but not via your code, this suggests that the Request your code is sending is somehow different than what you intend. You'll need to compare the (successful) Request from cURL or Postman with the (unsuccessful) Request that your code is generating. (See step #2 below.)</li>
		</ul><br/><br/>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Examine the Request that your code is sending (including the HTTP verb, URI, headers, and Request body) and the Response that it's receiving back from Smartsheet (including the HTTP status code, headers, and response body).</b><br/><br/>
		<ul>
			<li>If you've implemented Request / Response logging in your application (as suggested in <a href="#api-best-practices">API Best Practices</a>), inspect the full trace of Request and Response in the log file. Compare the Request that your application is logging with the (successful) Request from cURL or Postman, and update your code to correct any discrepancies.<br/><br/></li>
			<li>Alternatively, you may choose to use a tool like <a href="http://www.telerik.com/fiddler" target="_blank">Fiddler</a> or <a href="http://www.charlesproxy.com/" target="_blank">Charles HTTP Proxy</a> to inspect the full trace of Request and Response as it goes across the wire. Compare the Request trace that your application generates with the (successful) Request from cURL or Postman, and update your code to correct any discrepancies.<br/><br/></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

### Testing with cURL

cURL is a command-line utility that you can use to execute HTTP requests. 
It works on a variety of platforms (PC, Mac, etc.) and provides a quick and easy way to test REST API calls. 
To get started with cURL, go [here](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html). 
Once you've installed cURL, you can use the cURL code samples in this API documentation (found within the **cURL** tab of the code samples panel) to test any Smartsheet API operation. 

### Testing with Postman

Postman is a browser-based REST API client that you can use with Google Chrome to execute HTTP requests. 
It provides a much friendlier UI than cURL and also allows you to save configuration settings and REST API requests, making it quick and easy to resume testing at any time (without having to create everything from scratch each time). 
To get started with Postman, go [here](https://www.getpostman.com). 
Test any Smartsheet API request by using this API documentation to determine the HTTP verb, URI, Headers, and Request Body that the operation requires, and plugging that information into Postman to test the request.
<aside class="notice">Postman is one of many browser-based REST API clients. Other popular options include:<ul><li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo" target="_blank">Advanced REST Client</a> (for Google Chrome)</li><li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rest-web-service-client/ecjfcmddigpdlehfhdnnnhfgihkmejin" target="_blank">Rest Web Service Client</a> (for Google Chrome)</li><li><a href="http://restclient.net/" target="_blank">REST Client</a> (for Mozilla Firefox)</li><li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rest-easy/" target="_blank">REST Easy</a> (for Mozilla Firefox)</li></ul></aside>

## Authentication

The Smartsheet API utilizes OAuth 2.0 for Authentication and Authorization. 
An **Authorization** HTTP header containing an Access Token is required to authenticate requests. 
Access Tokens can be acquired in one of two ways:
<ul>
<li>via the Smartsheet UI ([User-generated Access Tokens](#user-generated-access-tokens)) </li>
<li>via OAuth 2.0 (see [Third-party Access Tokens](#third-party-access-tokens))</li>
</ul> 

### User-generated Access Tokens

Smartsheet users can easily generate Access Tokens by logging in to their Smartsheet account. 
Once a token is generated, it can be used in a script or custom application, or with an API integration service like Zapier, to access any Smartsheet data which the token owner already can access in the application. 
See [Direct API Access](#direct-api-access) for more information on user-generated tokens.

### Third-party Access Tokens

Third-party developers are able to build applications that can acquire Access Tokens using OAuth 2.0. 
See [Third Party App Development](#third-party-app-development) for more information.

## Access Levels

Throughout the API we have "Share" objects that represent the shared user's access level. 
Also, on Sheets, Workspaces and Templates, there is an **accessLevel** attribute that describes the current user's access level to that object. 
This corresponds directly to the sharing and access controls of Smartsheet that are available through the Smartsheet UI. 
The **accessLevel** attribute has one of the following values:

     |     |
-----|-----|
VIEWER | The user has read-only access to the resource.
EDITOR | The user can edit the resource, but cannot alter the structure of, delete or share the resource.
EDITOR_SHARE | The same as EDITOR, but with the ability to share the resource to other users.
ADMIN | The user can edit and share the resource, and can alter the structure of the resource as well.
OWNER | The user has complete control over the resource.

<%= partial "snippets/rateLimiting.md.erb" %>

## Errors

<%= partial "snippets/errorHandling.md.erb" %>

### Error Handling
 
The following table specifies the recommended action for each Smartsheet-specific error code. 
Use this information to implement error handling logic according to the following guidelines:

* If the error code indicates a permanent error condition, do not retry the request.
* If the error code indicates a problem that can be fixed, do not retry the request until the problem has been fixed.
* If the error code indicates a problem that could be overcome by retrying the request after a period of time, retry the request using exponential backoff.

## Column Types

Smartsheet supports the following standard column types, which are represented in a [Column object](#column-object) with a **type** attribute set to one of the following:

Column Type | Column.type Value | Notes |
------------|--------------------------|-------|
Text/Number		| TEXT_NUMBER	|
Contact List	| CONTACT_LIST	|
Date			| DATE			|
Dropdown List	| PICKLIST		| Custom, RYG, Harvey Ball, Priority types, etc.
Checkbox 		| CHECKBOX		| Checkbox, star, and flag types
Duration		| DURATION		| **Only for dependency-enabled project sheets**<br/>The API does not support setting a Column to this type. (This can only be done through the Smartsheet web application when configuring a project sheet.)
Predecessor		| PREDECESSOR	| **Only for dependency-enabled project sheets**<br/>The API does not support setting a Column to this type, or updating data in a column of this type. (This can only be done through the Smartsheet web application when configuring a project sheet.) 
Date/Time 		| ABSTRACT_DATETIME | Represents a project sheet's Start and End dates.<br/>**Only for dependency-enabled project sheets**<br/>The API does not support setting a Column to this type. (This can only be done through the Smartsheet web application when configuring a project sheet.) Additionally, the API does not support updating data in the End Date column under any circumstance, and does not support updating data in the Start Date column if Predecessor is set for that row.
Date/Time		| DATETIME		| Used only by the following System-generated columns: <ul><li>Created (Date) (**Column.systemColumnType** = "CREATED_DATE")</li><li>Modified (Date) (**Column.systemColumnType** = "MODIFIED_DATE")</li></ul>

<aside class="notice">See the <a href="#cell-values">Cell Values</a> section for information on getting and setting cell values for the different column types.</aside>

### Symbol Columns

In addition to the basic column types above, the Smartsheet app also supports columns that display symbols. These are simply specialized columns of type PICKLIST or CHECKBOX,
whose **[symbol](#column-object)** attribute is set to one of the values below:

**Symbols for CHECKBOX columns:**

<% CHECKBOX_SYMBOL_LIST = "<ul><li>STAR</li><li>FLAG</li></ul>" %>

<%= CHECKBOX_SYMBOL_LIST %>

**Symbols for PICKLIST columns:**

<% PICKLIST_SYMBOL_LIST = "<ul><li>HARVEY_BALLS</li><li>PRIORITY</li><li>RYG</li><li>PRIORITY_HML</li><li>DECISION_SYMBOLS</li><li>DECISION_SHAPES</li><li>VCR</li><li>RYGB</li><li>RYGG</li><li>WEATHER</li><li>PROGRESS</li><li>ARROWS_3_WAY</li><li>ARROWS_4_WAY</li><li>ARROWS_5_WAY</li><li>DIRECTIONS_3_WAY</li><li>DIRECTIONS_4_WAY</li><li>SKI</li><li>SIGNAL</li><li>STAR_RATING</li><li>HEARTS</li><li>MONEY</li><li>EFFORT</li><li>PAIN</li></ul>" %>

<%= PICKLIST_SYMBOL_LIST %>
 
<aside class="notice">The Smartsheet grid user interface presents several row attributes and features (e.g., row number, attachments, discussions, row action indicator, etc.) visually as columns.  The API does not consider these to be columns, and does not return or otherwise expose them as columns.  The only columns returned by the API are user data columns.</aside>

### System Columns

In addition to the standard column types and symbols, Smartsheet has a number of *system columns*, which represent data that is
filled in by Smartsheet and whose values cannot be changed by the user. These columns are represented with standard
[column types](#column-types), with the **[Column.systemColumnType](#column-object)** attribute set to one of the following:

Column.systemColumnType Value | Column Type | Notes
-----|-----|-----|
MODIFIED_DATE | DATETIME
MODIFIED_BY | CONTACT_LIST
CREATED_DATE | DATETIME
CREATED_BY  | CONTACT_LIST
AUTO_NUMBER | TEXT_NUMBER | Columns of this system column type will include an [AutoNumberFormat object](#autonumberformat-object) that describes the mask used to generate the value.

## Cell Values

Within the Smartsheet web application, all editable column types are flexible and cells in those columns can contain either
a value specific to the column type (e.g. dates, checkboxes, symbols, etc.) or a free-form text value.  This allows for a very
flexible UI and is one of the key benefits to using Smartsheet.

<aside class="notice">See the <a href="#column-types">Column Types</a> section for information on the different column types.</aside>

### Cell Value Representation

[Cell objects](#cell-object) retrieved through the Smartsheet API's have two main attributes representing cell values: **Cell.value**, and
**Cell.displayValue**.  A third attribute, **Cell.objectValue** is currently used only for adding and updating predecessors.
An empty cell is always represented by **null** for all of these attributes.

**Cell.displayValue** is always a **string** and is only returned for certain column types (see below).  It represents the formatted value as it should
be displayed to an end-user.  For example, if a TEXT_NUMBER column is formatted as a US Dollar currency, its **value** may be a number
like 1234.5678, but its **displayValue** would be "$1,234.57".

**Cell.value** represents a cell's raw value and can be one of the following primitive JSON types: **string**, **number**, or **boolean**,
depending on the column type.  Complex types are represented as strings, formatted as described below:

<% PROJECT_COLUMN_HELP_URL = "http://help.smartsheet.com/customer/portal/articles/765737-project-sheet-columns-start-date-end-date-duration-complete-and-predecessors" %>

| Column Type | Possible Types for Cell.value | Returns Cell.displayValue?
|-------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------
| TEXT_NUMBER	| **string**: free-form text values<br/>**number**: numeric values											| Yes: same as **value** for strings; for number values, the number with formatting applied.
| CONTACT_LIST	| **string**: an email address representing a contact, or a free-form text value.							| Yes: same as **value** for free-form strings; for contacts, the contact's name if any, else their email address.
| DATE			| **string**: a date in [ISO-8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format, or a free-form text value.<br/>**number**: see [Dates and Times](#dates-and-times) for how to request dates to be returned as numbers. | No.
| PICKLIST		| **string**: one of the picklist's column options, or a free-form text value.<br/>**number**: numeric values| Yes: same as **value** for strings; for number values, the number with formatting applied.
| CHECKBOX		| **boolean**: `true` if the checkbox is checked, `false` otherwise.<br/>**string**: a free-form text value.| No.
| DURATION		| **string**: a duration value such as "4d 6h 30m" in the user's locale, or a free-form text value.<br/>See the [Help Center](<%= PROJECT_COLUMN_HELP_URL %>) for more information on durations.| Yes: same as **value**
| PREDECESSOR	| **string**: a comma-delimited predecessor list such as "12FS +3d 4h, 14SS", or a free-form text value.<br/>See the [Help Center](<%= PROJECT_COLUMN_HELP_URL %>) for more information on predecessors.| Yes: same as **value**
| ABSTRACT_DATETIME | **string**: a project date and time in [ISO-8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format, or a free-form text value.<br/>**number**: see [Dates and Times](#dates-and-times) for how to request dates to be returned as numbers. | No.

**Cell.objectValue** is an object representation of a cell's value and is currently used for adding or updating predecessor cell values.
It provides a more "programmer friendly" format for assembling predecessors. To update a cell's predecessors, set objectValue to a
[PredecessorList object](#predecessorlist-object) containing [Predecessor objects](#predecessor-object).

### Cell Value Parsing

The flexibility in cell value data types is a powerful feature in the Smartsheet application, but at the same time, it poses a challenge
for an API in terms of parsing. Being too flexible will likely result in unexpected behavior. For instance, if you write code
to post a Date value to a Smartsheet and the API operation succeeds,  you might assume that the date value you sent was interpreted
as date. What happens if you posted your date in the wrong format? Do you really want Smartsheet to keep the malformed date
as a Text value? Probably not.
 
To address this problem, the Smartsheet API employs a simple scheme to indicate whether you want a more predictable and strict
interface or a more flexible one. By default, a cell value is expected to conform to "strict" rules for the type of the cell's column.
If an input value doesn't conform, the API will return [error code 1042](#errors).

If, however, you want the same flexibility as the Smartsheet web application, you can disable the strict rules, and we’ll do our best to make
sense of it. To enable lenient parsing simply include `"strict" : false` in the [Cell object](#cell-object) in your request body.

The parsing rules for the various column types are as follows:

**TEXT_NUMBER**:

     |     |
-----|-----|
*Strict* | All numeric and text values are valid and are interpreted literally.
*Lenient* | All numeric and text values are valid. Formatted numbers passed as text values, such as currencies ("$5,000"), percentages ("50%"), or decimals ("100.5")  will be parsed to their numeric equivalents, based on the locale of the Access Token owner,  with the proper formatting enabled for the cell.

<aside class="notice">The Smartsheet application only supports numeric values in the range -9007199254740992 to 9007199254740992. If using strict parsing, any numeric value outside that range will result in <a href="#errors">error code 1148</a>. If using lenient parsing, the value will be silently converted to text.</aside>

**PICKLIST**:

     |     |
-----|-----|
*Strict* | The value must be a string and must be one of the options for the Picklist.
*Lenient* | All numeric and text values are valid. Formatted numbers will be parsed like TEXT_NUMBER formatted numbers.

**DATE**:

     |     |
-----|-----|
*Strict* | The value must be a string value and a valid ISO 8601 date (YYYY-MM-DD).
*Lenient* | We will attempt to convert the string value to date using ISO 8601 date format, as well as several locale-specific date formats. If the value is a parsable date format, we will recognize the date and store it as such. All other values are simply text values.

<aside class="notice">You may use the query string parameter <b>numericDates</b> with a value of <code>true</code> to enable strict parsing of dates in numeric format.  See <a href="#dates-and-times">Dates and Times</a> for more information.</aside>

**CONTACT_LIST**:

     |     |
-----|-----|
*Strict* | The value must be a valid email address. If "displayValue" is set, we use that as the name, otherwise if we find a match among the the Access Token owner's contacts, we will associate this cell with that existing contact.
*Lenient* | If the value is a valid email address, we handle it the same way as Strict. If not, we save the value as a text value.

<aside class="notice">See <a href="#contact-list-columns">Contact List Columns</a> for more information.</aside>

**CHECKBOX**:

     |     |
-----|-----|
*Strict* | Only boolean values (true or false) are valid.
*Lenient* | Boolean values and string values of "true" and "false" are handled the same as Strict. All other values are saved as text values.

**DURATION**:

     |     |
-----|-----|
*Strict* | Only valid duration strings in the user's locale are valid.  Information on duration strings can be found in the [Help Center](<%= PROJECT_COLUMN_HELP_URL %>).
*Lenient* | Numeric values are treated as duration values in days.  String values which are valid duration strings in the user's locale are treated as durations, and any other values are treated as free-form text values.

<aside class="notice">You may use the query string parameter <b>projectParseLocale</b> with a <a href="#server-information">supported locale string</a> to force parsing in the specified locale (e.g. using <code>en_US</code> will let you send in English values regardless of the user's locale)</aside>

**PREDECESSOR**:

The Smartsheet API doesn't support parsing of predecessor strings, so strict and lenient parsing don't apply to predecessors.  Instead, you can set the **objectValue** attribute to a [PredecessorList object](#predecessorlist-object) containing
[Predecessor objects](#predecessor-object). To set a cell in a predecessor column to a non-predecessor string value, simply set **objectValue** to a string.

**ABSTRACT_DATETIME**:

     |     |
-----|-----|
*Strict* | The value must be a string value and a valid ISO 8601 date and time.
*Lenient* | We will attempt to convert the string value to date using ISO 8601 date format, as well as several locale-specific date formats. If the value is a parsable date format, we will recognize the date and store it as such. All other values are simply text values.

<aside class="notice">You may use the query string parameter <b>numericDates</b> with a value of <code>true</code> to enable strict parsing of dates in numeric format.  See <a href="#dates-and-times">Dates and Times</a> for more information.</aside>

#### Contact List Columns

With columns of type CONTACT_LIST, cells’ "value" and "displayValue" attributes are treated independently. 
The contact’s email address is represented by **value**, while the contact’s name (and the value displayed in the cell in the Smartsheet app) is represented by **displayValue**.
 
When creating or updating cells for a contact list column, the **displayValue** attribute works as follows:
<ul>
<li>If **displayValue** is non-null and non-empty, the Smartsheet cell will display the value provided.</li>
<li>If **displayValue** is an empty string, the Smartsheet cell will display the email address.</li>
<li>If **displayValue** is null or absent, Smartsheet will make a best guess effort at filling it in with a contact’s name based on the email address.</li>
</ul>

## Paging

The Smartsheet API contains a number of *index endpoints* (typically denoted in the documentation with titles beginning with "Get All..." or "List...") which return arrays of objects.
Examples include `GET` [/users](#list-users), [/sheets](#list-sheets), [/sheets/{sheetId}/columns](#get-all-columns), and many others.  These endpoints all support pagination, meaning
you can retrieve paged subsets of results, enabling you to process potentially large result sets in smaller chunks.

### Paging Query String Parameters
Index endpoints all support pagination via the following optional query string parameters:

     |     |     |
-----|-----|-----|
**pageSize** 	| number  | The maximum number of items to return per page.  Unless otherwise stated for a specific endpoint, defaults to **100** if not specified.
**page**		| number  | Which page to return.  Defaults to **1** if not specified.  If you specify a value greater than the total number of pages, the last page of results will be returned.
**includeAll**  | boolean | If true, include all results (i.e. do not paginate).  Mutually exclusive with **pageSize** and **page** (they are ignored if **includeAll**=true is specified).

<aside class="notice">Most index endpoints default to a page size of 100 results.  If you need all results at once, you should specify the <code class="prettyprint">includeAll=true</code> query string parameter.</aside>

### Paged Responses

Index endpoints all return paged responses via an **IndexResult** object which provides paging metadata that can be used to navigate the full set of pages in the result set:

<%= partial "snippets/indexResult_object.md.erb" %>

## Bulk Operations

The Smartsheet API supports a number of bulk operations that can operate on multiple objects.  Unlike single-object operations, bulk operations allow you to create, update, or delete
mulitple objects in a single request, which we recommend as a [best practice](#api-best-practices) for optimal performance.

The following API operations currently allow you to do things in bulk:

* [Add Column(s)](#add-column(s))
* [Add Favorite(s)](#add-favorite(s))
* [Remove Favorite(s)](#remove-favorites-(in-bulk))
* [Add Group Member(s)](#add-group-member(s))
* [Add Row(s)](#add-row(s))
* [Copy Row(s) to Another Sheet](#copy-row(s)-to-another-sheet)
* [Delete Row(s)](#delete-row(s))
* [Move Row(s) to Another Sheet](#move-row(s)-to-another-sheet)
* [Send Row(s) via Email](#send-row(s))
* [Update Row(s)](#update-row(s))

### Optional Bulk Operations

Several endpoints support *optional* bulk `POST` operations which exist alongside the standard single-object `POST`.  For these endpoints, you may pass in either a single object, or an array of objects.
Depending on what was passed in, the [Result object](#result-object) returned will contain either a single object, or an array.  An example optional bulk operation is [POST /favorites](#add-favorite(s)): you can
pass in a single [Favorite object](#favorite-object) to create a single favorite, or an array of Favorite objects to create multiple favorites in a single request.  Endpoints which support bulk operations will be
noted as such in their API reference documentation.

**NOTE**: Several `POST` operations fail when attempting to create a single object which already exists (e.g. favorites, shares, group members).  However, for the corresponding bulk operations, these endpoints will *not*
return an error if one or more items in the array already exist.  Existing items will simply be ignored, and [Result object](#result-object) returned will omit them.

<aside class="notice">As we make future updates to the API, we may add bulk support to additional endpoints.  Because the endpoints will continue to support single-object semantics, this will not result in a breaking change, and existing code will continue to function.</aside>

### Partial Success

In general, the default behavior for bulk operations is to fail outright if any of the objects in the request are invalid for some reason.  If successful, all objects in the request will be created/updated/deleted;
if not, none of them will be.

However, there are some operations that support *partial success*, which means the operation will still succeed even if one or more of the objects in the request failed for some reason (e.g. an object is invalid).  Partial success is typically
*not* the default mode for an operation, and instead must be explicitly enabled by using a query string parameter.  This will be noted in the documentation for operations that support partial success.

<%= PARTIAL_SUCCESS %>

## Dates and Times

The Smartsheet API returns all dates and times in the [UTC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) time zone, in [ISO-8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format.  If a date/time needs to be
displayed to an end-user in their local time zone, you will need to do the conversion using the user's time zone which you can obtain by [getting the current user](#get-current-user).

You can optionally choose to receive and input dates/times in numeric format, as milliseconds since the UNIX epoch (midnight on January 1, 1970 in UTC time), using the query string parameter **numericDates** with a value of `true`.
This flag works for any API request.

Developer accounts provide access to the full range of features and functionality available in production. 
They are easy to set up, will not expire, and will let you focus on your development without any risk to your production data.
 
To set up a Developer account, please visit the Smartsheet Developer Portal [registration page](http://www.smartsheet.com/developers/register). 
If you already have a paid Smartsheet account and your goal is to keep your development and production accounts separate, make sure to use a different email address when registering.
 
Please note that Developer accounts are intended for development and testing purposes only, and are subject to the [Smartsheet Developer Program Agreement](https://www.smartsheet.com/files/SmartsheetDeveloperProgramAgreement20150630.pdf).

## SDKs and Sample Code

Smartsheet SDKs (client libraries) are available in a variety of languages. 
For the complete list, see our [SDK page](http://www.smartsheet.com/developers/sdks). 
Submit your vote for additional language coverage by emailing us at <a href="mailto:api@smartsheet.com">api@smartsheet.com</a>.

This API documentation currently contains sample code in the following languages: 
<ul>
<li>cURL</li>
<li>C#</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Node.js</li>
<li>Python</li>
</ul>

For each operation, you'll see sample code displayed in the dark blue panel next to the operation. 
To view the sample code in a specific language, select the corresponding language tab along the top of the dark blue panel. 
Each [C#](#c#-sample-code), [Java](#java-sample-code), and [Node.js](#node.js-sample-code) code sample demonstrates how to execute an operation using the corresponding [Smartsheet SDK](http://www.smartsheet.com/developers/sdks). 
See the corresponding section below for more information about using the sample code in a specific language.

### cURL Sample Code

```shell
# For cURL code samples, see each operation in the API REFERENCE section.
```

The cURL code samples included in this API documentation demonstrate how to execute operations using the command line data transfer tool [cURL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL). 

### C# Sample Code

```csharp
using Smartsheet.Api;
using Smartsheet.Api.Models;
using Smartsheet.Api.OAuth;

// Set the Access Token.
Token token = new Token();
token.AccessToken = "INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE";

// Use the Smartsheet Builder to create an instance of SmartsheetClient.
SmartsheetClient smartsheet = new SmartsheetBuilder().SetAccessToken(token.AccessToken).Build();

// Get current user.
smartsheet.UserResources.GetCurrentUser();

// Get server info.
smartsheet.ServerInfoResources.GetServerInfo();

// For additional C# code samples, see each operation in the API REFERENCE section.
```

The C# code samples included in this API documentation demonstrate how to execute operations using the [Smartsheet C# SDK](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-csharp-sdk). 
To use the C# SDK, you'll need to include the appropriate **using** directives in your code. For example:

<code>
using Smartsheet.Api;<br/>
using Smartsheet.Api.Models;<br/>
using Smartsheet.Api.OAuth;<br/>
</code>

Each code sample uses a **SmartsheetClient** object called "smartsheet" that can be created as follows:

<code>
// Set the Access Token<br/>
Token token = new Token();<br/>
token.AccessToken = "INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE";<br/>
</code>

<code>
// Use the Smartsheet Builder to create an instance of SmartsheetClient<br/>
SmartsheetClient smartsheet = new SmartsheetBuilder().SetAccessToken(token.AccessToken).Build();
</code>

For operations that support querystring parameters, the C# code sample often contains multiple example requests, each one showing a different combination of querystring parameters. 
The code samples are intended for example purposes only and should not be considered to cover all possible combinations of querystring parameters. 

Within the C# code samples, the **...Id** naming convention is used to denote an object ID that will need to be replaced with an actual object ID, should you use the code in your application.
For example, in the following code example, **sheetId** should be replaced with the actual ID of the Sheet and **rowId** should be replaced with the actual ID of the Row:  

<code>smartsheet.SheetResources.RowResources.DiscussionResources.CreateDiscussion(sheetId, rowId, discussion);</code>

### Java Sample Code

```java
import com.smartsheet.api.*;
import com.smartsheet.api.models.*;
import com.smartsheet.api.models.enums.*;
import com.smartsheet.api.oauth.*;

// Set the Access Token.
Token token = new Token();
token.setAccessToken("INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE");

// Use the Smartsheet Builder to create an instance of Smartsheet.
Smartsheet smartsheet = new SmartsheetBuilder().setAccessToken(token.getAccessToken()).build();

// Get current user.
smartsheet.userResources().getCurrentUser();

// Get server info.
smartsheet.serverInfoResources().getServerInfo();

// For additional Java code samples, see each operation in the API REFERENCE section.
```

The Java code samples included in this API documentation demonstrate how to execute operations using the [Smartsheet Java SDK](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-java-sdk). 
To use the Java SDK, you'll need to include the appropriate **import** directives in your code. For example:

<code>
import com.smartsheet.api.&#42;;<br/>
import com.smartsheet.api.models.&#42;;<br/>
import com.smartsheet.api.models.enums.&#42;;<br/>
import com.smartsheet.api.oauth.&#42;;<br/>
</code>

Each code sample uses a **Smartsheet** object called "smartsheet" that can be created as follows:

<code>
// Set the Access Token<br/>
Token token = new Token();<br/>
token.setAccessToken("INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE");<br/>
</code>

<code>
// Use the Smartsheet Builder to create an instance of Smartsheet<br/>
Smartsheet smartsheet = new SmartsheetBuilder().setAccessToken(token.getAccessToken()).build();<br/>
</code>

For operations that support querystring parameters, the Java code sample often contains multiple example requests, each one showing a different combination of querystring parameters. 
The code samples are intended for example purposes only and should not be considered to cover all possible combinations of querystring parameters. 

Within the Java code samples, the **...Id** naming convention is used to denote an object ID that will need to be replaced with an actual object ID, should you use the code in your application.
For example, in the following code example, **sheetId** should be replaced with the actual ID of the Sheet and **rowId** should be replaced with the actual ID of the Row:  

<code>smartsheet.sheetResources().rowResources().discussionResources().createDiscussion(sheetId, rowId, discussion);</code>

### Node.js Sample Code

```javascript
var client = require('smartsheet');
var smartsheet = client.createClient({accessToken:'INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'});

// Get current user.
smartsheet.users.getCurrentUser()
    .then(function(data) {
        console.log(data);
    })
    .catch(function(error) {
        console.log(error);
    });

// Get server info.
smartsheet.server.getInfo()
    .then(function (data) {
        console.log(data);
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
        console.log(error);
    });

// For additional Node.js code samples, see each operation in the API REFERENCE section.
```

The Node.js code samples included in this API documentation demonstrate how to execute operations using the [Smartsheet JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-javascript-sdk), with promises. 
Each code sample uses a root module called "smartsheet" that can be created as follows:

<code>
var client = require('smartsheet');<br/>
var smartsheet = client.createClient({accessToken:'INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'});
</code>

Once you've created the **smartsheet** variable, you can use it to execute API operations. 
For example, the following code example shows how to execute the [Get Current User](#get-current-user) operation.

<code>
smartsheet.users.getCurrentUser()<br/>
&#160;&#160;.then(function(data) {<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;console.log(data);<br/>
&#160;&#160;})<br/>
&#160;&#160;.catch(function(error) {<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;console.log(error);<br/>
&#160;&#160;});<br/>
</code>

For more information about using the [Smartsheet JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-javascript-sdk), including examples of using callbacks (instead of promises), see the [SDK Readme](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-javascript-sdk).

### Python Sample Code

```python
import smartsheet
smartsheet = smartsheet.Smartsheet()

# Get Current User
me = smartsheet.Users.get_current_user()
print(me)

# Get server info.
info = smartsheet.Server.server_info()

# For additional Python code samples, see each operation in the API REFERENCE section.
```

The Python samples included in this API documentation demonstrate how to execute operations using the [Smartsheet Python SDK](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-python-sdk). 
To use the Python SDK, you'll first need to include the appropriate **import** directive in your code: 

<code>import smartsheet</code>

Next, create the base client object that will be used to execute API requests via the SDK:

<code>smartsheet = smartsheet.Smartsheet()<br/></code>

<aside class="notice">The snippet above assumes that your Smartsheet API Access Token has been set as an environment variable named <b>SMARTSHEET_ACCESS_TOKEN</b>. If you prefer, you may alternatively pass your Smartsheet Access Token to the instantiation of the Smartsheet object like this: <code>smartsheet = smartsheet.Smartsheet('INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE')</code></aside>

Once you've created the **smartsheet** object, you can use it to execute API operations. For example, the following example shows how to execute the [Get Current User](#get-current-user) operation.

<code>
me = smartsheet.Users.get_current_user()<br/>
print(me)<br/>
</code>

Within the Python code samples, the **...Id** naming convention is used to denote an object ID that will need to be replaced with an actual object ID, should you use the code in your application.
For example, in the following code example, **sheetId** should be replaced with the actual ID of the Sheet and **rowId** should be replaced with the actual ID of the Row:

<code>smartsheet.Discussions.create_discussion_on_row(<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;sheetId,<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;rowId,<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;smartsheet.models.Discussion({<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;'title': 'Expense Reimbursement',<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;'comment': smartsheet.models.Comment({<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;'text': 'Expenses greater than $500 require manager approval.'<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;})<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;})<br/>
)</code>

## Direct API Access

Smartsheet makes it easy to directly access your data via the API. 
The first step is to generate an Access Token via the Smartsheet UI. 
Users can generate and have more than one active token at any time. 
Access Tokens generated in Smartsheet UI are long lived, meaning they won’t expire for 10 years. 
They are best used in system-level integrations, such as applications designed to keep Smartsheet and other systems in sync, or to integrate with Zapier, ifttt or similar API integration services.

### Generating Access Token

These instructions assume that you already have an existing Smartsheet account. Follow these steps to generate an Access Token:
<ol>
<li>Click the **Account** button in the upper-left corner of your Smartsheet screen and select **Personal Settings**.  This will open the Personal Settings form.</li>
<li>Click the **API Access** button to open the API Access form.
<li>Use the API Access form to generate new or manage existing acces tokens.
</ol>
 
Because you can generate and have more than one active token at any time, you have the ability to implement a granular security policy by designating a separate token for each application or integration scenario you may have. 
That way, should any one token become compromised, you can easily revoke it without impacting any of your other API-enabled applications.
 
<aside class="notice">You will have only one opportunity to view and copy your newly generated token. For security reasons, you will not be able to retrieve it at a later time. If you lose your token, however, it is easy to use the UI to revoke it and generate a new one.</aside>
 
<aside class="success">Access Tokens are essentially passwords and grant the holder access to all of your Smartsheet data. It is imperative that you keep them secure.</aside>

### Using Access Tokens

> Example Request:

```shell
curl https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/users/me \
`-H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

```javascript
// Set the access token.
var client = require('smartsheet');
var smartsheet = client.createClient({accessToken:'INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'});

// Get current user.
smartsheet.users.getCurrentUser()
	.then(function(data) {
		console.log(data);
	})
	.catch(function(error) {
    	console.log(error);
  	});
```

```csharp
// Set the access token.
Token token = new Token();
token.AccessToken = "INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE";
SmartsheetClient smartsheet = new SmartsheetBuilder().SetAccessToken(token.AccessToken).Build();

// Get current user.
smartsheet.UserResources.GetCurrentUser();
```

```java
// Set the access token.
Token token = new Token();
token.setAccessToken("INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE");
Smartsheet smartsheet = new SmartsheetBuilder().setAccessToken(token.getAccessToken()).build();

// Get current user.
smartsheet.userResources().getCurrentUser();
```

```python
# Create base client object and set the access token.
smartsheet = smartsheet.Smartsheet('INSERT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE')

# Get current user.
smartsheet.Users.get_current_user()
```

> Example Response:

```json
{
    "email": "john.doe@smartsheet.com",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "id": 48569348493401200
}
```

Once you have an Access Token, include it in the **Authorization** header for every request you make:

`Authorization: Bearer 0da6cf0d848266b4cd32a6151b1`

The header name is <b>Authorization</b> and the value of the header is <b>Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN</b>, where ACCESS_TOKEN is a token generated by you. Since the access token is being transmitted in clear text, all API calls are done over HTTPS.

## Third Party App Development

In addition to being a powerful work management tool, Smartsheet is a powerful application platform. 
We are committed to making it easy to build applications on top of Smartsheet - whether you are developing a solution for your organization or creating an app for the Smartsheet customer community at large. 
We are here to support you and would love your feedback on how to improve the API and the developer experience.
 
As a developer, you may be building applications that allow any Smartsheet user to access his or her Smartsheet data. 
Doing so requires that you complete the following steps.

1. [Complete your Developer Profile](#developer-registration) 
2. [Register your App](#registering-your-app)
3. Within your app, [implement a 3-legged OAuth flow](#oauth-flow) to obtain an access token that can be used to access Smartsheet data on behalf of an end user. 
 
### Developer Registration

Third party app registration and management is available via the Developer Tools. 
To get access to Developer Tools, you must first [register](http://www.smartsheet.com/developers/register) as a Smartsheet developer. 
Follow the instructions on the registration form to add Developer Tools to an existing Smartsheet account or create a new Smartsheet developer account.
 
Once you complete the developer registration, log in to Smartsheet to access Developer Tools.  
<ol>
<li>Click the **Account** button in the upper-left corner of your Smartsheet screen.</li>
<li>Now that you are registered as a Smartsheet developer, you should see a new **Developer Tools** option in the dropdown menu. Select it to open Developer Tools.</li>
<li>Before you can register your first app, you will need to complete your developer profile. Developer profile is a public profile that anyone can access to learn more about you and your applications.</li>
<li>Once your developer profile is complete, you will be able to use **Developer Tools** to register and manage your apps.</li>
</ol>

### Registering Your App

To build a third party app, you must first register it with Smartsheet using Developer Tools:
<ol>
<li>Login to Smartsheet.</li>
<li>Click the **Account** button in the upper-left corner of your Smartsheet screen and select **Developer Tools**.</li>
<li>Create new app and provide the required information, including name, description, contact info and a redirect URL. Redirect URL (also known as the "callback URL") is the URL in your app where Smartsheet must redirect after authentication is complete.</li>
<li>Use the generated app **client id** and **secret** to connect your app to Smartsheet. See [OAuth Flow](#oauth-flow) for details on how to use **client id** and **secret** to do that.</li>
</ol>

### Access Scopes

In order to access an end user's Smartsheet data, your application must explicitly ask for specific Access Scopes. 
The Access Scopes enable your app to communicate to the end users what type of operations it will be performing. 
Access Scopes do not override existing Access Level restrictions. 
For example, having the Access Scope of WRITE_SHEETS will not allow your app to update a sheet on which the end user has read-only permission.
 
The Access Scopes are as follows:

     |     |
-----|-----|
READ_SHEETS | Read all sheet data, including comments, attachments and cell data
WRITE_SHEETS | Insert and modify sheet data, including comments, attachments and cell data
SHARE_SHEETS | Share sheets, including sending sheets as attachments
DELETE_SHEETS | Delete sheets
CREATE_SHEETS | Create new sheets
CREATE_SIGHTS | Create new sights
READ_SIGHTS | Read all sight data
DELETE_SIGHTS | Delete sight
SHARE_SIGHTS | Share sight
READ_USERS | Retrieve users and groups for your Smartsheet organization
READ_CONTACTS | Retrieve contacts
ADMIN_USERS | Add and remove users from your Smartsheet organization; create groups and manage membership
ADMIN_SHEETS | Modify sheet structure, including column definition, publish state, etc.
ADMIN_SIGHTS | Modify sight structure
ADMIN_WORKSPACES | Create and manage workspaces and folders, including sharing



 
<aside class="notice"><b>Additional Info:</b><ul><li>User-generated Access Tokens are granted all of these permissions.</li><li>Third-party apps must request at least one access scope, but should only request the scopes necessary.</li><li>Once a third-party app attains a valid access token, it will be able to execute <a href="#get-current-user">Get Current User</a> operation, regardless of which access scopes were requested.</li></ul></aside>

### OAuth Flow

Your app must implement a 3-legged OAuth flow to retrieve an access token that can be used to access Smartsheet data on behalf of an end user. 
This process involves the following steps:

1. [Request authorization from the user](#requesting-authorization-from-the-user)
2. [Obtain the authorization code](#obtaining-the-authorization-code)
3. [Use the authorization code to obtain an access token](#obtaining-an-access-token)
4. [Refresh the access token](#refreshing-an-access-token) (as necessary)

#### Requesting authorization from the user

To request authorization from an end user, direct your user to `https://app.smartsheet.com/b/authorize` with the following parameters through either a `GET` or `POST`. The parameter values must be URL-encoded:

     |     |
-----|-----|
response_type<br/>(required) | must be set to "code"
client_id<br/>(required) | client id for your app
redirect_uri<br/>(optional) | redirect URL you [registered](#registering-your-app) for your app (including protocol, e.g. "http://"); if not provided, the redirect URL set during registration is used
scope<br/>(required) | space-delimited list of [access scopes](#access-scopes) to which you are asking the user to grant access (note the spaces must be URL-encoded as "%20")
state | arbitrary string that will be returned to your app; intended to be used by you to ensure that this redirect is indeed from an OAuth flow that you initiated

Here is an example of a URL to which you would send your user as a `GET` request:
 
`https://app.smartsheet.com/b/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=dheu3dmkd32fhxme&scope=READ_SHEETS%20WRITE_SHEETS&state=MY_STATE`
 
If your user has not logged in to Smartsheet, he/she will first be directed to the Smartsheet login page. 
After a successful login, your user will be prompted to allow or deny the access scopes you requested.

#### Obtaining the authorization code

If the user clicks "Allow", he/she will be redirected to the **redirect_uri** with the following parameters:

     |     |
-----|-----|
code | authorization code required to obtain access token
expires_in | number of seconds code is valid once issued; this is always 4 minutes - you must obtain an access token within that time
state | **state** string specified earlier

If the user clicks "Deny", he/she will be redirected to the **redirect_uri** with the following parameters:

     |     |
-----|-----|
error | "access_denied"
state | **state** string specified earlier

Other errors that may be returned include:

     |     |
-----|-----|
unsupported_response_type | response_type must be set to "code"
invalid_scope | one or more of the requested access scopes are invalid. Please check the list of access scopes

#### Obtaining an access token

> Request an access token:

```shell
curl https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/token \
-d 'grant_type=authorization_code&code={your_code}&client_id={your_client_id}&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}&hash={SHA_256(app_secret|code)}' \
-X POST
```

```javascript
// [todo]
```

```csharp
// [todo]
```

```java
// [todo]
```

```python
# [todo]
```

> Successful Response:

```json
{
   "access_token": "Access Token Value",
   "token_type": "bearer",
   "refresh_token": "Refresh Token Value",
   "expires_in": "# of seconds before token expires"
}
```

> Error Response:

```json
{
   "errorCode": "Smartsheet error number",
   "error": "OAuth error type",
   "error_description": "Error description"
}
```

Once you’ve successfully obtained an authorization code, the next step is to obtain an access token. 
To do so, you’ll need to make a `POST` request to `https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/token` with the following parameters:

     |     |
-----|-----|
grant_type<br/>(required) | must be set to "authorization_code"
client_id<br/>(required) | client id for your app
code<br/>(required) | authorization code returned in the [previous step](#obtaining-the-authorization-code)
redirect_uri<br/>(optional) | redirect URL [registered](#registering-your-app) for your app, including the protocol (e.g., "http://"); if not provided, the redirect URL set during registration is used
hash<br/>(required) | SHA-256 hash of your App secret concatenated with a pipe and the authorization code.  The app_secret is never sent with the request.

<aside class="notice">The "Get Token" request must have the <b>Content-Type</b> header set to 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'.</aside>

Possible OAuth error types:

     |     |
-----|-----|
invalid_request | The request parameters are invalid or missing.
invalid_client | The client information is invalid. Ensure your client id is correct.
invalid_grant | The authorization code or refresh token is invalid or expired, the redirect_uri does not match, or the hash value does not match the App secret and/or code.
unsupported_grant_type | grant_type must equal "authorization_code" or "refresh_token".

#### Refreshing an access token

> Refresh an access token:

```shell
curl https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/token \
-d 'grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token={your_refresh_token}&client_id={your_client_id}&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}&hash={SHA_256(app_secret|refresh_token)}' \
-X POST
```

```javascript
// [todo]
```

```csharp
// [todo]
```

```java
// [todo]
```

```python
# [todo]
```

> Successful Response:

```json
{
   "access_token": "Newly refreshed Access Token",
   "expires_in": "# of seconds before token expires",
   "token_type": "bearer",
   "refresh_token": "New refresh token"
}
```

An access token is valid for one week but you can use the refresh token to obtain a new access token. 
Once you obtain the new access token, you can use it in place of the old one, which is no longer valid.
 
To do so, you’ll need to make a `POST` request to `https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/token` with the following parameters:

     |     |
-----|-----|
grant_type<br/>(required)| must be set to "refresh_token"
client_id<br/>(required)| client id for your app
refresh_token<br/>(required)| refresh_token value that came with the access token
redirect_uri<br/>(optional)| redirect URL [registered](#registering-your-app) for your app, including the protocol (e.g., "http://")
hash<br/>(required)| SHA-256 hash of your App secret concatenated with a pipe and the refresh token value

<aside class="notice">The "Refresh Token" request must have the <b>Content-Type</b> header set to 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'.</aside>

##### Getting basic user info
Once you have obtained an access token on behalf of the user, you can fetch basic information (including user ID, name, etc.) about the caller using the [Get Current User](#get-current-user) operation.

# Admin Features

Smartsheet users with System Admin rights have access to additional API features, including user management and ability to access any sheet in the organization.

## Manage Users

As an org Administrator, you can provision, de-provision and otherwise manage users in your Smartsheet organization.  See [Users](#users) for more information on relevant API calls.

## Assume-User

> Example Request:

```shell
curl https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/users/me \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN" \
-H "Assume-User: john.doe%40smartsheet.com" 
```

```javascript
// [todo]
```

```csharp
// Create the 'smartsheet' object and set the 'Assume-User' header value to "john.doe@smartsheet.com".
SmartsheetClient smartsheet = new SmartsheetBuilder().SetAccessToken(token.AccessToken).SetAssumedUser("john.doe@smartsheet.com").Build();

// Get current user (call gets executed as "john.doe@smartsheet.com").
UserProfile userProfile = smartsheet.UserResources.GetCurrentUser();
```

```java
// Create the 'smartsheet' object and set the 'Assume-User' header value to "john.doe@smartsheet.com".
Smartsheet smartsheet = new SmartsheetBuilder().setAccessToken(accessToken).setAssumedUser("john.doe@smartsheet.com").build();

// Get current user (call gets executed as "john.doe@smartsheet.com").
UserProfile user= smartsheet.userResources().getCurrentUser();
```

```python
# Create the 'smartsheet' object and run the assume_user method.
smartsheet = smartsheet.Smartsheet()
smartsheet.assume_user('john.doe@smartsheet.com')

# Get the current user (call executed as "john.doe@smartsheet.com").
user = smartsheet.Users.get_current_user()

# Reset the 'smartsheet' object so no Assume-User header is used in further requests.
smartsheet.assume_user()
```

> Example Response:

```json
{
    "email": "john.doe@smartsheet.com",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "id": 48569348493401200
}
```

As an org Administrator, you can assume the identity of any user in your organization. 
This advanced feature enables a number of useful business scenarios, such as executing an organization-wide backup or maintaining data attribution when integrating with another system.
 
Here is how it works. 
Simply add an **Assume-User** header to your call, with the URI-encoded email address of the user whose identity you want to assume as the value. 
For example, if you want to assume the identity of **john.doe@smartsheet.com** and john.doe@smartsheet.com is a confirmed member of your Smartsheet organization, you would add the following header:

`Assume-User: john.doe%40smartsheet.com`

You can then act on behalf of the user and make API calls as though you were that user.

## Maintain Data Attribution

> Example Request:

```shell
curl https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/{sheetId}/discussions/{discussionId}/comments \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN" \
-H "Assume-User: john.doe%40smartsheet.com" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-X POST \
-d '{"text":"This is a new comment."}'
```

```javascript
// [todo]
```

```csharp
// Create the 'smartsheet' object and set the 'Assume-User' header value to "john.doe@smartsheet.com".
SmartsheetClient smartsheet = new SmartsheetBuilder().SetAccessToken(token.AccessToken).SetAssumedUser("john.doe@smartsheet.com").Build();

// Create comment.
Comment comment = new Comment.AddCommentBuilder("This is a new comment.").Build();

// Add comment to discussion (call gets executed as "john.doe@smartsheet.com").
smartsheet.SheetResources.DiscussionResources.CommentResources.AddComment(sheetId, discussionId, comment);
```

```java
// Create the 'smartsheet' object and set the 'Assume-User' header value to "john.doe@smartsheet.com".
Smartsheet smartsheet = new SmartsheetBuilder().setAccessToken(accessToken).setAssumedUser("john.doe@smartsheet.com").build();

// Create comment.
Comment comment = new Comment.AddCommentBuilder().setText("This is a new comment.").build();

// Add comment to discussion (call gets executed as "john.doe@smartsheet.com").
smartsheet.sheetResources().discussionResources().commentResources().addComment(sheetId, discussionId, comment);
```

```python
# Create the 'smartsheet' object and run the assume_user method.
smartsheet = smartsheet.Smartsheet()
smartsheet.assume_user('john.doe@smartsheet.com')

# Create comment.
comment = smartsheet.models.Comment({
    'text': 'Expense reports require manager approval.'
})

# Add comment to discussion (call executed as "john.doe@smartsheet.com").
smartsheet.Discussions.add_comment_to_discussion(sheetId, discussionId, comment)
```

> Example Response:

```json
{
    "message": "SUCCESS",
    "result": {
        "createdAt": "2013-02-28T22:58:30-08:00",
        "createdBy": {
            "email": "john.doe@smartsheet.com",
            "name": "John Doe"
        },
        "id": 6834973207488388,
        "modifiedAt": "2013-02-28T22:58:30-08:00",
        "text": "This is a new comment."
    },
    "resultCode": 0
}
```

If you are integrating Smartsheet with another API-enabled system, such as Salesforce, it may be useful to maintain attribution when adding data to Smartsheet. 
For example, let's say you want to add a new row to a Sales Pipeline sheet in Smartsheet whenever your sales team updates a sales pipeline in Salesforce. 
So, if Bob Johnson makes a change in Salesforce, wouldn't it be great to make the new row show up in Smartsheet as if it were created by Bob? 
Specifying the **Assume-User** header API requests allows org Administrators to develop integrations which do just that.
 
## List All Sheets

As an org Administrator, you can get a list of all sheets in your organization, regardless of ownership or whether or not the sheets have been shared to you. 
Please see [List All Org Sheets](#list-all-org-sheets) for more information.

## Backup All Org Data

> Get list of all sheets in the org:

```shell
curl https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/users/sheets \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

```javascript
smartsheet.sheets.listOrganizationSheets()
	.then(function(data) {
		console.log(data)
	})
	.catch(function(error) {
		console.log(error);
	});
```

```csharp
// List all org sheets.
smartsheet.UserResources.SheetResources.ListSheets();
```

```java
// List all org sheets.
smartsheet.userResources().listOrgSheets();
```

```python
action = smartsheet.Sheets.list_org_sheets()
sheets = action.result
```

> Fetch each sheet (using Assume-User):

```shell
curl https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/{sheetId}?include=discussions,attachments \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN" \
-H "Assume-User: OWNER_EMAIL"
```

```javascript
// [todo]
```

```csharp
// [todo]
```

```java
// [todo]
```

```python
dl_path = 'backup'
for org_sheet in sheets:
    smartsheet.assume_user(org_sheet.owner)
    sheet = smartsheet.Sheets.get_sheet(
        org_sheet.id,
        include='discussions,attachments'
    )
```

> Fetch each attachment:

```shell
curl -0 URL_TO_ATTACHMENT
```

```javascript
// [todo]
```

```csharp
// [todo]
```

```java
// [todo]
```

```python
for attachment in sheet.attachments:
	attachment_obj = smartsheet.Attachments.get_attachment(sheet.id, attachment.id)
	result = smartsheet.Attachments.download_attachment(attachment_obj, dl_path)
	if result.message == 'SUCCESS':
		print(result.filename + ' downloaded')
```

To backup all of the org data, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Get a list of all sheets in your organization.</li>
<li>For each sheet in the list, fetch the sheet (optionally including a list of discussions and attachments) by assuming the identity of the owner of the sheet. (The value of the **Assume-User** header must be the URI-encoded email address of the sheet owner.)</li>
<li>To backup all files attached to each sheet, fetch them one at a time, using your favorite download method. See [Get Attachment](#get-attachment) for more information.
</ol>

You can use the sheet version number to enable incremental backups. [Fetch the sheet version number](#get-sheet-version) and compare it to the last backed up version number (you will need to store the sheet ID and the last backup up version number) - if they are the same, no need to include the sheet in your incremental backup run.

> Backup Script

```shell
mkdir backup
curl https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/users/sheets \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
...
```

```javascript
// [todo]
```

```csharp
// [todo]
```

```java
// [todo]
```

```python
import smartsheet
import os

os.mkdir('backup')
os.chdir('backup')

smartsheet = smartsheet.Smartsheet()

action = smartsheet.Sheets.list_org_sheets()
sheets = action.result

for org_sheet in sheets:
    os.mkdir(str(org_sheet.id))
    dl_path = os.path.realpath(str(org_sheet.id))
    
    smartsheet.assume_user(org_sheet.owner)
    sheet = smartsheet.Sheets.get_sheet(
        org_sheet.id,
        include='discussions,attachments'
    )
    
    # download all attachments
    for attachment in sheet.attachments:
        attachment_obj = smartsheet.Attachments.get_attachment(sheet.id, attachment.id)
        result = smartsheet.Attachments.download_attachment(attachment_obj, dl_path)
        if result.message == 'SUCCESS':
            print(result.filename + ' downloaded')
            
    # download sheet itself
    smartsheet.Sheets.get_sheet_as_csv(org_sheet.id, dl_path)

```

# Attachments

Attachments can exist on a [Comment](#comments) (i.e., within a Discussion), on a [Row](#rows), or on a [Sheet](#sheets).

## <%= OBJECTS %>

### Attachment Object

     |     |     |
-----|-----|-----|
**id** | number | Attachment ID
**name** | string | Attachment name
**url** | string | Attachment temporary URL (files only)
**urlExpiresInMillis** | number | Attachment temporary URL time to live (files only) 
**attachmentType** | string | Attachment type (one of FILE, GOOGLE_DRIVE, LINK, BOX_COM, DROPBOX, EVERNOTE, EGNYTE, ONEDRIVE)
**attachmentSubType** | string | Attachment sub type, valid only for either GOOGLE_DRIVE attachments or EGNYTE attachments:<ul><li>possible values for GOOGLE_DRIVE attachments: DOCUMENT, SPREADSHEET, PRESENTATION, PDF, DRAWING</li><li>possible values for EGNYTE attachments: FOLDER</li></ul>
**createdAt** | timestamp | A timestamp of when the attachment was originally added
**createdBy** | [User](#user-object) | User object containing name and email of the creator of this attachment
**mimeType** | string | Attachment MIME type (PNG, etc.)
**parentType** | string | The type of object the attachment belongs to. One of "SHEET", "ROW", or "COMMENT"
**parentId** | number | The id of the parent 
**sizeInKb** | number | The size of the file, if the attachmentType is FILE  

## Posting an Attachment

Like the Smartsheet web application, the Smartsheet API allows uploading files to Sheets, Rows and Comments. 
You can upload a file by performing either a *simple upload* or a *multipart upload*. 

A [simple upload](#simple-uploads) allows you to add a single file attachment to the specified object. 
For example, you can perform a simple upload to upload a file to a [sheet](#attach-file-to-sheet), [row](#attach-file-to-row), or [comment](#attach-file-to-comment). 

A [multipart upload](#multipart-uploads) allows you to add a single file attachment to the specified object (i.e., attach a file to a [sheet](#attach-file-to-sheet), [row](#attach-file-to-row), or [comment](#attach-file-to-comment)), or to create an object and attach a file using a single request. 
For example, you can perform a multipart upload to [create a new Comment](#add-comment) that contains a single file attachment or to [add a new Discussion to a Sheet](#create-discussion-on-sheet) that contains a single file attachment.

<aside class="notice">Important Notes:<ul><li>Max file size for uploads through the API is currently limited to 30mb.</li><li>Posting an attachment is a resource-intensive operation and incurs 10 additional requests against the rate limit.</li></ul></aside>

### Multipart Uploads

A multipart upload request allows you to add a single file attachment to the specified object (i.e., attach a file to a [sheet](#attach-file-to-sheet), [row](#attach-file-to-row), or [comment](#attach-file-to-comment)), or to create an object and upload a file using a single request. 
For example, you can perform a multipart upload to [create a new Comment](#add-comment) that contains a single file attachment or to [add a new Discussion to a Sheet](#create-discussion-on-sheet) that contains a single file attachment.

<aside class="notice">Most programming languages have libraries that can be used to assemble multipart requests.</aside>

A multipart upload request must include the following HTTP headers:

     |     |
-----|-----|
**Content-Type** | Must be set to `multipart/form-data`, and include the boundary string that will separate the parts in the request payload.
**Content-Length** | The length of the request payload.

The request body of a multipart upload request contains one or more *parts*, each part containing either JSON or a file to upload. 
The request body must contain at least one part. 
Each part must start with the boundary string specified in the **Content-Type** request header, and must contain the following part headers:

     |     |
-----|-----|
**Content-Disposition** | Contains the following semicolon-delimited items:<ul><li>`form-data`</li><li>`name=`"*partname*"</li><li>`filename=`"*filename*" (only required for file parts)</li></ul><b><i>Note</i></b>: Values specified in the Content-Disposition header must be URL-encoded.
**Content-Type** | The content type of the part: `application/json` for JSON objects, or the applicable MIME type for file parts

The last part in the request must be followed by the boundary string, followed by two hyphens.

The documentation for each operation that supports multipart uploads will specify the number and names of parts that are expected for the operation. 
File parts must have the part name "file", and documentation for operations which allow for JSON object parts will specify the required part name for the JSON part.

The following example shows a multipart upload request that creates a Comment containing the specified text and file attachment:

`POST https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/4509093797881732/discussions/2889925487028100/comments`  
`Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN`  
`Content-Length: 29008`  
`Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----gU8h01zAAp3LagBr`  

`------gU8h01zAAp3LagBr`  
`Content-Disposition: form-data; name="comment"`  
`Content-Type: application/json`  

`{ "text": "Please review the attached image." }`  
`------gU8h01zAAp3LagBr`  
`Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="picture.jpg"`  
`Content-Type: image/jpeg`  

*< Binary content for file >*  
`------gU8h01zAAp3LagBr--`

### Simple Uploads

A [simple upload](#simple-uploads) allows you to add a single file attachment to the specified object. 
For example, you can perform a simple upload to upload a file to a [sheet](#attach-file-to-sheet), [row](#attach-file-to-row), or [comment](#attach-file-to-comment). 

To perform this kind of upload, you must set specific headers to tell Smartsheet about the file. The following three headers are required: 

     |     |
-----|-----|
**Content-Disposition** | `attachment` to tell the API that a file is in the body of the POST request, followed by a semicolon, followed by `filename=` and the URL-encoded filename in quotes
**Content-Type** | Can be left blank if it is not known (but must be present), and Smartsheet will make its best guess based on the extension of the file. 
**Content-Length** | Must be set to the size of the file, in bytes. For example to determine file size using in UNIX: <p>`$ ls -l ProgressReport.docx`<br/>`5463 ProgressReport.docx`</p>

The following example request shows a simple upload that adds a file attachment to a Sheet:

`POST https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/4509093797881732/attachments`  
`Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN`

## Update Cell(s)

To update the Cells in a Sheet, use the [Update Row(s)](#update-row(s)) operation.

## <%= RELATED %>

### Images in Cells

For details about working with images in cells, see [Cell Images](#cell-images).

### Cell Links

Creating or updating cell links via the **cell.linkInFromCell** attribute is a special operation. 
A given row or cell update operation may contain only link updates, or no link updates. 
Attempting to mix row/cell updates with cell link updates will result in error code 1115. 
Additionally, a [cell link](#celllink-object) can only be added to an *existing* cell, so the **cell.linkInFromCell** attribute is not allowed when POSTing a new row to a sheet.
 
When creating a cell link, **cell.value** must be null (the data will be pulled from the linked cell).
 
A cell may not contain both a hyperlink and a cell link, so **hyperlink** and **linkInFromCell** may never both be non-null at the same time.

### Hyperlinks

You can create and modify [hyperlinks](#hyperlink-object) by using any API operation that creates or updates cell data. 
When creating or updating a hyperlink, **cell.value** may be set to a string value or null. 
If null, the cell's value will be derived from the hyperlink: 
<ul><li>If the hyperlink is a URL link, the cell's value will be set to the URL itself.</li><li>If the hyperlink is a sheet or report or Sight link, the cell's value will be set to the sheet or report or Sight name.</li></ul>

# Cell Images

A 'cell image' is an image that has been uploaded to a Cell within a Sheet.

## <%= OBJECTS %>

**id** | string | Image ID
**width** | number | Original width (in pixels) of the uploaded image
**height** | number | Original height (in pixels) of the uploaded image
**altText** | string | Alternate Text for the image

### ImageUrl Object

     |     |     |

-----|-----|-----|
**type** | string | One of:<ul><li>workspace</li><li>folder</li><li>sheet</li><li>report</li><li>template</li><li>Sight</li></ul>
**objectId** | number | ID of the favorited item.  If **type** is "template", only private sheet-type template ID is allowed.

## <%= RELATED %>

A Row is comprised of a collection of Cells, and may optionally contain Attachments and/or Discussions.

### Row Attachments

For details about working with a Row's attachments, see [Attachments](#attachments).

### Row Cells

For details about working with a Row's cells, see [Cells](#cells).

For details about working with images in cells, see [Cell Images](#cell-images).

### Row Discussions

For details about working with a Row's discussions, see [Discussions](#discussions).

### Row Include Flags

Endpoints which return rows (e.g. [get sheet](#get-sheet), [get row](#get-row)) support the optional **include** query string parameter. If specified, the value of the **include** parameter is 
a comma-delimited list of flags that indicate additional attributes to be included in each [Row object](#row-object) within the response.

Include Flag | Notes |
-------------|-------|
**discussions**	| Includes row **discussions** array.<br/>To include discussion attachments, both **attachments** and **discussions** must be present in the include list.
**attachments**	| Includes row **attachments** array.<br/>To include discussion attachments, both **attachments** and **discussions** must be present in the include list.
**format**		| Includes **format** attribute on the row and its cells.  See [Formatting](#formatting).
**filters**		| Includes **filteredOut** attribute indicating if the row should be displayed or hidden according to the sheet's filters.
**columnType**	| Includes **columnType** attribute in the row's [cells](#cell-object) indicating the type of the column the cell resides in.
**rowPermalink** | Includes **permalink** attribute that represents a direct link to the [row](#row-object) in the Smartsheet application.
**rowWriterInfo** | Includes **createdBy** and **modifiedBy** attributes on the row, indicating the row's creator, and last modifier.
**objectValue** | Includes **objectValue** attribute on cells containing values. For more information see [Cell Values](#cell-values).

### Row Location

When using the [Add Row(s)](#add-row(s)) operation to insert new rows into a sheet or the [Update Row(s)](#update-row(s)) to move rows in a sheet, 
the following "location-specifier" [Row](#row-object) attributes can be used to specify where the rows get added or moved to in the sheet:

* toTop
* toBotom
* above
* siblingId
* parentId
* indent (applicable when updating a row only)
* outdent (applicable when updating a row only)

The following table describes which *location-specifier* Row attribute(s) should be set to implement various actions.

Action | Row attribute(s)
-------|--------
Add or move the Row to the top of the Sheet. | **toTop** = `true`
Add or move the Row to the bottom of the Sheet. | **toBottom** = `true`
Add or move the Row directly above the specified sibling Row (at the same hierarchical level). | **above** = `true`<br/>**siblingId** = (ID of sibling row)
Add or move the Row directly below the specified sibling Row (at the same hierarchical level). | **siblingId** = (ID of sibling row)
Add or move the Row so that it is the first child row of the specified parent Row. | **parentId** = (ID of parent row)
Add or move the Row so that it is the last child row of the specified parent Row. | **parentId** = (ID of parent row)<br/>**toBottom** = `true`
Indent an existing Row. | **indent** = (number of level to indent, minimum of 1)
Outdent an existing Row. | **outdent** = (number of level to outdent, minimum of 1)

<aside class="notice"><b>Troubleshooting errors:</b>&#160;&#160;If you receive an Error response when attempting to (individually) move both a parent Row and its child Row(s) in a single request, try achieving the objective by using two separate requests: 1) Move parent Row. 2) Move child Row(s).</aside>

## ContainerDestination Object

Object that describes the destination container when a Sheet or Folder is moved, or when a Sheet, Folder, or Workspace is copied.

     |     |     |

**destinationId** | number | ID of the destination container (when copying or moving a Sheet or a Folder). Required if **destinationType** is "folder" or "workspace" If **destinationType** is "home", this value must be null.
**newName** | string | Name of the newly created object (when creating a copy of a Sheet, Folder, Sight, or Workspace). This attribute is not supported for "move" operations (i.e., a moved Sheet, Folder, Sight, or Workspace retains its original name).
 
## IndexResult Object

Object returned for all `GET` operations against index endpoints.  This object provides metadata which can be used to perform paging on potentially large data sets.  See the [Paging](#paging) section for more information.

<%= partial "snippets/indexResult_object.md.erb" %>

## Result Object

Object returned for all `PUT` operations and `POST` operations (and for some other operations). 

     |     |     |
-----|-----|-----|
**resultCode** | number | 0 (zero) if successful, 3 for partial success of a bulk operation.
**message** | string | Message that indicates the outcome of the request. (One of SUCCESS or PARTIAL_SUCCESS)
**result** | Object | Object that was created or updated (if applicable)
**version** | number | New version of the Sheet.<br/>*Applicable only for operations which update sheet data* 
**failedItems** | [BulkItemFailure](#bulkitemfailure-object)[] | Array of BulkItemFailure objects which represents the items that failed to be added or updated. See [Partial Success](#partial-success) for more information.<br/>*Applicable only for bulk operations that support partial success*

## BulkItemFailure Object

Object that contains information about an item that failed to be added or updated as specified by a bulk request.

     |     |     |
-----|-----|-----|
**index** | number | The index of the failed item in the bulk request array
**error** | [Error object](#errors) | The error caused by the failed item
**rowId** | number | The id of the [Row](#row-object) that failed.<br/>*Applicable only to bulk row operations* 

# Formatting

Formatting data can optionally be included for columns, rows, and cells by adding the "include=format" query string parameter to any API operation that returns any of those objects (for example, `GET /sheets/{sheetId}`, `GET sheets/{sheetId}/rows/{rowId}`, etc.).  When this parameter is included, objects that contain non-default formatting will include a **format** property.  Objects which do not have any non-default format settings applied will exclude this property.
 
Because the amount of format data in a large sheet can potentially be very large in itself, for bandwidth reasons, format data is represented by a compact format descriptor string.  The format descriptor takes the form of a comma-separated list of numeric values.  These values represent indexes into pre-defined format lookup tables which can be retrieved using the `GET /serverinfo` operation.

## Row & Column Format

Setting the format of a row or column through the API simply sets the baseline format for new cells in that row or column.  It does not affect existing cells.
 
The equivalent API action for what happens when you highlight a column or row in the Smartsheet web app and set a format (e.g. bold) would be to update the format of a column or row (via `PUT /sheets/{sheetId}/rows/{rowId}` or `PUT /sheets/{sheetId}/columns/{columnId}`), and update the format for every cell in that row or column.  All of the cells in a row can be updated in one operation (`PUT /sheets/{sheetId}/rows/{rowId}`), but there is currently no way to update all of the cells in a column in one operation.  This will be addressed in a future version of the API.

## Format Descriptor

The format descriptor contains 16 comma-separated numeric indexes.  Each index represents a format style whose value can be found in one of the lookup tables in the [FormatTables object](#formattables-object).

**Format Descriptor Element #** | **Format Style** | **FormatTables Lookup Table Property** |
-----|-----|-----|
0 | Font Family | fontFamily
1 | Font size | fontSize
2 | Bold | bold
3 | Italic | italic
4 | Underline | underline
5 | Strikethrough | strikethrough
6 | Horizontal alignment | horizontalAlign
7 | Vertical alignment | verticalAlign
8 | Text color | color
9 | Background color | color
10 | Taskbar color | color
11 | Currency | currency
12 | Decimal count | decimalCount
13 | Thousands separator | thousandsSeparator
14 | Number format | numberFormat
15 | Text wrap | textWrap

<aside class="notice">Formats which have not been explicitly set are omitted in the descriptor string.  For example, a cell which has been set to bold and italic, but has no other formats applied to it, would have a format descriptor of ",,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,".</aside>

<aside class="notice">As a convenience, the FormatTables object contains a <b>defaults</b> property which is a format descriptor that describes which formats the Smartsheet web application displays for unset formats.  Your application can use these values to display unformatted cells identically to the Smartsheet web application.</aside>

## FormatTables Object

The FormatTables object is retrieved via the `GET /serverinfo` operation and contains all of the lookup tables that the [Format Descriptor](#format-descriptor) indexes refer to, as well as a property called **defaults**, which is a Format Descriptor that describes which formats the Smartsheet web application displays for unset formats.
 
<aside class="notice">Indexes and their values are guaranteed never to change or be removed for a given major API version.  However, new values could potentially be added to the ends of lookup tables.<br/><br/>Because of this possibility, your code should handle the case where a cell might contain a format index value greater than the size of a lookup table your app has loaded.  Your application should check for that case and reload the format tables if necessary.</aside>

     |     |     |
-----|-----|-----|
**defaults** | string | A format descriptor where each element describes the formats the Smartsheet web application displays for format values that have not been set.
**fontFamily** | array of [FontFamily objects](#fontfamily-object) | Font families with additional font information
**fontSize** | array of strings | Font sizes in points
**bold** | array of strings | Possible values:<ul><li>none</li><li>on</li></ul>
**italic** | array of strings | Possible values:<ul><li>none</li><li>on</li></ul>
**underline** | array of strings | Possible values:<ul><li>none</li><li>on</li></ul>
**strikethrough** | array of strings | Possible values:<ul><li>none</li><li>on</li></ul>
**horizontalAlign** | array of strings | Horizontal alignment, possible values:<ul><li>default</li><li>left</li><li>center</li><li>right</li></ul>Note: "default" is the default value, which is equivalent to "left".
**verticalAlign** | array of strings | Vertical alignment, possible values:<ul><li>default</li><li>top</li><li>middle</li><li>bottom</li></ul>Note: "default" is the default value, which is equivalent to "top".
**color** | array of strings | Color hex values. <br/><br/>Note: "none" is the default value for all colors.  Applications will need to handle this value and use app-defined colors (typically this is Black for text color and White for background color)
**currency** | array of [Currency objects](#currency-object) | Currency codes and symbols
**decimalCount** | array of strings | All allowed decimal count values
**thousandsSeparator** | array of strings | Possible values:<ul><li>none</li><li>on</li></ul>

**textWrap** | array of strings | Possible values:<ul><li>none</li><li>on</li></ul>

## FontFamily Object

     |     |     |
-----|-----|-----|
**name** | string | Name of the font family (e.g. "Arial")
**traits** | array | Platform-independent traits of the font family. One of the following values:<ul><li>serif</li><li>sans-serif</li>

## Currency Object

     |     |     |
-----|-----|-----|
**code** | string | The ISO 4217 currency code (e.g. "EUR")
**symbol** | string | The currency symbol (e.g. "€")

# <span class="customTOCSectionHeading">Deprecations</span>

Smartsheet occasionally deprecates APIs to indicate that those APIs should no longer be used in active development. 
Deprecated APIs typically remain present and usable for a reasonable period of time following the release in which they were deprecated, but may be removed entirely from a future version of the API. 
You should never use deprecated APIs in new development, and if you have existing code that uses deprecated APIs, we recommend that you update that code as soon as possible. 

# Endpoints

This section specifies the endpoints and parameters that have been deprecated in version 2.0 of the Smartsheet API.

## Deprecated Endpoints

The following endpoints have been deprecated in version 2.0 of the Smartsheet API.

# <span class="customTOCSectionHeading">Webhooks</span>

# Intro to Webhooks

<%= WEBHOOKS_INTRO %> 

At a high-level, it works like this:

<ol>
	<li><span class="customInstructionsHeading">Your application subscribes to <a href="#event-callbacks">callbacks</a>.</span><br/>First, you need to subscribe to event notifications (callbacks) by creating one or more webhooks.  You can create a webhook manually via the API or have your application create a webhook dynamically.  Each webhook must specify:
		<ul>
			<li>Which Smartsheet object to monitor for events</li>
			<li>Which events in that object should trigger a callback</li>
			<li>The HTTPS URL (i.e., "<b>callback URL</b>") where Smartsheet should send callbacks when any of the specified events occur within the scope of the specified Smartsheet object. (Note: Smartsheet webhooks do not support callbacks to servers using self-signed certificates)</li>
		</ul> 
		<br/>
		
		<b>Webhook examples in plain English:</b> 
		<ul>
			<li><i>"When any changes occur in Sheet_A, send a callback to https://www.myapp.com/abc"</i></li>
			<li><i>"When a new row is added to Sheet_B, send a callback to https://www.myapp.com/def"</i></li>
			<li><i>"When a cell value is changed in Sheet_C, send a callback to https://www.myapp.com/ghi"</i></li>
		</ul>
		<br/>
	</li>
	<li><span class="customInstructionsHeading">When any of the specified events occur within an object that is being monitored by a webhook, Smartsheet sends an <code>HTTP POST</code> (i.e., "callback") to the <b>callback URL</b> that is associated with the Webhook.</span><br/>
		<ul>
			<li><i>Note:</i> The callback payload is a "skinny" payload -- it indicates which objects changed and the type of events that occurred, but does not contain any data from the objects themselves.</li>
		</ul> 
		<br/>
	</li>
	<li><span class="customInstructionsHeading">Your application receives, acknowledges, and processes callbacks.</span><br/>Your application receives the <code>HTTP POST</code>, acknowledges the callback by responding with HTTP status 200, and processes the callback. 
	Because the callbacks are "skinny", you may need to make one or more requests to the Smartsheet API to retrieve the actual data associated with the change.
	</li>
</ol>

## Webhook Management

Webhooks are created and managed by using the Smartsheet API. See [Webhooks API Reference](#webhooks) for details about the related API operations. 

## Webhook Ownership & Access

Webhooks can be created and managed via [Direct API Access](http://smartsheet-platform.github.io/api-docs/#direct-api-access) or by a [third-party app](http://smartsheet-platform.github.io/api-docs/#third-party-app-development). 

A webhook that is created via Direct API Access:

* is owned by the User who created it
* can be managed only by the User who created it
* will not be affected if the access token that was used to create it is revoked, as long as the User remains active

A webhook that is created by a [third-party app](http://smartsheet-platform.github.io/api-docs/#third-party-app-development):

* is owned by the User who authorized the third-party app (and is associated with the third-party app)
* can be managed by the third-party-app (as long as it maintains authorization) OR by the User who owns it
* will be permanently disabled if the third-party app's permissions are revoked

## Webhook Scope & Events

A webhook monitors the specified **scope** for the specified **events**. 

A [Webhook's](#webhook-object) **scope** attribute indicates the scope of the subscription. It is specified when [creating a webhook](#create-webhook), and cannot subsequently be changed. 

* Currently, "sheet" is the only supported value for the **scope** attribute. 
* Future releases of webhooks will support additional scopes such as "org", "folder", "workspace", etc.

A [Webhook's](#webhook-object) **event** attribute indicates the set of events that a webhook is subscribed to (i.e. which events will trigger a callback).

* Events are represented as a dot-separated string in the format "*object*.*event*", where an asterisk (&#42;) can be used to represent "all objects" or "all events".
* Currently, "&#42;.&#42;" is the only supported value for the **events** attribute. This indicates a subscription to all objects in the scope, and all events for those objects.
* Future releases of webhooks will support more specific events such as "sheet.updated", "row.deleted", "column.created", etc.

<span class="customSubHeading">Example</span>

Consider a [Webhook](#webhook-object) with the following attribute values:

* **scopeObjectId** = 12345678901234
* **scope** = "sheet" 
* **events** = "&#42;.&#42;" 

This webhook monitors the specified Sheet (id: 12345678901234) for all types of events. For example, if a row is added to the sheet, cell values are updated in the sheet, a column is deleted from the sheet, etc., a callback would be sent to the webhook's **callbackUrl**.

# Creating a Webhook

An API client can create a webhook by using the [Create Webhook](#create-webhook) operation. A newly created webhook is disabled by default.
After successfully creating a webhook, the API client must subsequently initiate and complete the [verification process](#webhook-verification) before the webhook will become enabled. 
The following diagram illustrates the process of creating and enabling a Webhook. 

<img src="images/v4-CreateAndEnableWebhook.png" />

<span class="customSubHeading">Step-by-Step:</span>

The process occurs synchronously:

1. API Client submits a [Create Webhook](#create-webhook) request.

2. Smartsheet creates the webhook, but does not initially enable the webhook (`enabled: false` and `status: "NEW_NOT_VERIFIED"`).

3. To initiate the verification process, the API Client submits an [Update Webhook](#update-webhook) request to specify `enabled: true`. (*Note*: The API Client will not receive a response to this request until the Verification process (steps 4 and 5) has completed.)

4. When Smartsheet receives the request to enable the webhook, it sends a [Verification Request](#webhook-verification) to the Subscriber (i.e., to the `callbackUrl` that the API Client specified in the **Create Webhook** request). 
The request specifies a unique random value in the **Smartsheet-Hook-Challenge** header and contains only `webhookId` in the request body.

5. The Subscriber responds to the Verification Request by echoing back the same unique random value in the **Smartsheet-Hook-Response** header of the response.

6. Once the Subscriber has successfully acknowledged the Verification Request, Smartsheet enables the webhook and responds to the API Client's **Update Webhook** request to confirm that the webhook has been enabled (`enabled: true` and `status: "ENABLED"`). 

## Webhook Verification

> Verification Request (from Smartsheet):

```test
POST [callbackUrl]
Smartsheet-Hook-Challenge: d78dd1d3-01ce-4481-81de-92b4f3aa5ab1 
{ 
    "webhookId": 2674017481058180
}
```

> Verification Response (by Subscriber):

```test
HTTP status: 200 OK
Smartsheet-Hook-Response: d78dd1d3-01ce-4481-81de-92b4f3aa5ab1 
```

When an API Client attempts to enable a webhook, Smartsheet will send a verification request to the webhook's **callbackUrl** to verify that the Subscriber expects and is able to successfully receive callbacks. 
The request specifies a unique random value in the **Smartsheet-Hook-Challenge** header and contains a JSON object in the request body with only a `webhookId` attribute.

* To verify the webhook, the Subscriber's response to the Verification Request must return a 200 HTTP status code and must echo back the same unique random value in the **Smartsheet-Hook-Response** header of the response. Once Smartsheet receives this verification response, the webhook will be enabled (`enabled: true` and `status: "ENABLED"`).

* If the Subscriber does not successfully respond to the verification request, the webhook will remain disabled (`enabled: false` and `status: "DISABLED_VERIFICATION_FAILED"`).

When a webhook is initially [created through the API](#create-webhook), the response will contain the webhook's ID.  If you wish to guarantee that your server only receives callbacks for webhooks that you created,
you can check the verification request's `webhookId` attribute against your list of created webhook IDs.  If the ID is not in the list, return a response with a non-200 status code (for example, 403 Forbidden),
and the webhook that initiated the verification request will be disabled as described above.

<aside class="notice"><b>IMPORTANT</b>: ONGOING VERIFICATION. Once a webhook has been enabled, Smartsheet will send Smartsheet will send a verification request to the webhook's <b>callbackUrl</b> once every 100 callbacks. The Subscriber should respond to the verification request as described above -- failure to do so will result in the webhook being disabled (<code>enabled: false</code> and <code>status: "DISABLED_VERIFICATION_FAILED"</code>).</aside>

# Webhook Status

A [Webhook](#webhook-object) object's **enabled** attribute indicates whether a webhook is enabled or disabled, while the **status** attribute describes the *reason* that the webhook is enabled or disabled.

<aside class="notice"><b>Note:</b><ul><li>When a Webhook's <b>enabled</b> attribute is set to <code>true</code>, Smartsheet is monitoring for the specified events and will send a <a href="#event-callbacks">callback</a> to the <b>callbackUrl</b> when the events occur.</li><li>When a Webhook's <b>enabled</b> attribute is set to <code>false</code>, Smartsheet is NOT monitoring for the specified events and will NOT send a callback to the <b>callbackUrl</b> when the events occur. Depending on the value of the <b>status</b> attribute, it may be possible to (re-)enable the Webhook. (See below for details).</li></ul></aside>

The following table lists all possible combinations of **enabled** and **status** attribute values.

Webhook.enabled | Webhook.status | Meaning | Notes
----- | ----- | ------ | -----
true  | ENABLED | Webhook is active. | 
false | NEW_NOT_VERIFIED | Webhook has been created but is not enabled because it has not yet been verified. |  Owner can re-enable the webhook by using the [Update Webhook](#update-webhook) operation to set **enabled** to `true`. Once the subscriber successfully acknowledges the [verification request](#webhook-verification), the webhook will become enabled.
false  | DISABLED_BY_OWNER | Webhook has been disabled by the owner. | Owner can re-enable the webhook by using the [Update Webhook](#update-webhook) operation to set **enabled** to `true`. Once the subscriber successfully acknowledges the [verification request](#webhook-verification), the webhook will become enabled.
false  | DISABLED_VERIFICATION_FAILED | Webhook verification has failed. |  Owner can re-enable the webhook by using the [Update Webhook](#update-webhook) operation to set **enabled** to `true`. Once the subscriber successfully acknowledges the [verification request](#webhook-verification), the webhook will become enabled.
false  | DISABLED_CALLBACK_FAILED | Webhook has been disabled because callback was not successfully delivered to the Callback URL. |  Owner can re-enable the webhook by using the [Update Webhook](#update-webhook) operation to set **enabled** to `true`. Once the subscriber successfully acknowledges the [verification request](#webhook-verification), the webhook will become enabled.
false  | DISABLED_APP_REVOKED | Webhook has been disabled because the third-party app associated with the webhook has had its access revoked. | This is a terminal state (i.e., webhook in this state cannot be re-enabled, and attempts to do so will result in error code 1153). If the third party app's access is subsequently restored, it will need to create new webhooks.
false  | DISABLED_SCOPE_INACCESSIBLE | Webhook has been disabled because its owner lost access to the corresponding data in Smartsheet (either because the object was deleted or sharing permissions were revoked). | Webhook will automatically be re-enabled if access to data is restored (i.e., if deleted object is restored or sharing permissions are restored).
false  | DISABLED_ADMINISTRATIVE | Webhook has been disabled by Smartsheet support. | A webhook in this state can only be re-enabled by Smartsheet (contact <a href="mailto:api@smartsheet.com">api@smartsheet.com</a>).  Attempting to re-enable a webhook in this state will result in error code 1154.

# Webhook Callbacks

A "callback" is the notification that Smartsheet sends to a webhook's **callbackUrl**. There are two types of callbacks:

* [**Event** callback](#event-callbacks): Alerts the subscriber when the specified event(s) have occurred in Smartsheet. This is the most common type of callback.

* [**Status Change** callback](#status-change-callbacks): Alerts the subscriber that a webhook has been automatically disabled due to loss of access or automatically re-enabled due to restoration of access.

A Subscriber has the ability to verify the integrity of a callback payload (i.e. ensure that the message was not tampered with en route) and authenticate the identity of its sender (i.e. ensure that the callback did indeed originate from Smartsheet). 
For more information, see [Authenticating Callbacks](#authenticating-callbacks-(optional)).

## Event Callbacks

> Example - Event callback (row created):

```json
{
    "nonce": "4b2ed20d-6f00-4b0c-8fac-082182aa9aac",
    "timestamp": "2015-10-27T17:04:23.795+0000",
    "webhookId": 4503604829677444,
    "scope": "sheet",
    "scopeObjectId": 4509506114742148,
    "events": [
        {
            "objectType": "sheet",
            "eventType": "updated",
            "id": 4509506114742148,
			"userId": 9007194052434043,
			"timestamp": "2015-10-27T17:03:15.000+0000"
        },
        {
            "objectType": "row",
            "eventType": "created",
            "id": 7129509179746180,
			"userId": 9007194052434043,
			"timestamp": "2015-10-27T17:03:15.000+0000"
        }
    ]
}
```

Smartsheet sends an Event callback to notify the Subscriber when the specified event(s) occur in Smartsheet.

<aside class="warning">Any events that occur while a webhook is disabled will NOT be communicated via callback if/when webhook is enabled.</aside>

<span class="customSubHeading">Callback Acknowledgement</span>

The Subscriber must respond to an event callback with a 200 [HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#2xx_Success) to acknowledge that the callback was received. 

<span class="customSubHeading">Retry Logic</span>

If the Subscriber fails to respond with a 200 status, depending on the response, Smartsheet may retry delivery up to 14 times. (The first 7 retry attempts occur with a frequency that's determined using exponential backoff; thereafter, retry attempts will occur once every three hours until all retries have been exhausted.)

Subscriber response | Will be retried?
----- | -----
HTTP 201 through 299 | No
HTTP 309 through 399 | No
HTTP 400 through 499 (except 410) | Yes
HTTP 410 | No
HTTP 500 through 599 | Yes
Any other HTTP status | No
Request timeout | Yes

If the response is not retriable or retry attempts have been exhausted, the webhook will be disabled (`enabled: false` and `status: "DISABLED_CALLBACK_FAILED"`).
A webhook in this state can be re-enabled if the subscriber completes the verification process. (See [Webhook Status](#webhook-status) for details.)

## Status Change Callbacks

> Status Change callback (access lost):

```json
{
    "nonce" : "20d4d741-6224-446f-b9c4-bf7802326192",
    "timestamp" : "2015-10-27T14:48:40.214+0000",
    "webhookId": 2674017481058180,
    "scope" : "sheet",
    "scopeObjectId" : 3407658024757124,
    "newWebhookStatus" : "DISABLED_SCOPE_INACCESSIBLE"
}
```

> Status Change callback (access restored):

```json
{
    "nonce" : "20d4d741-6224-446f-b9c4-bf7802326192",
    "timestamp" : "2015-10-27T14:48:40.214+0000",
    "webhookId": 2674017481058180,
    "scope" : "sheet",
    "scopeObjectId" : 3407658024757124,
    "newWebhookStatus" : "ENABLED"
}
```

If a webhook's owner loses access to the object that a webhook is monitoring (either because the object was deleted or the webhook owner's access to the object was revoked in Smartsheet), 
Smartsheet will automatically disable the webhook and send a Status Change callback to alert the Subscriber of this change in status. 
The **newWebhookStatus** attribute will indicate that the webhook is now disabled (because the scope is inaccessible).

If the webhook owner's access to the object is subsequently restored, 
Smartsheet will automatically re-enable the webhook and send a Status Change callback to alert the Subscriber of this change in status. 
The **newWebhookStatus** attribute will indicate that the webhook is now enabled.

## Authenticating Callbacks (optional)

> Calculating an HMAC

```shell
# See programming language tabs for language-specific examples.
```

```java
private static final String HMAC_SHA256_ALGORITHM = "HmacSHA256";
private static final int HMAC_RADIX = 16;

private String calculateHmac(String sharedSecret, String callbackBody) throws GeneralSecurityException {
	Mac mac = Mac.getInstance(HMAC_SHA256_ALGORITHM));
	mac.init(new SecretKeySpec(sharedSecret.getBytes(), HMAC_SHA256_ALGORITHM));

	byte[] rawHmac = mac.doFinal(callbackBody.getBytes());
	return new BigInteger(1, rawHmac).toString(HMAC_RADIX);
}
```

A Subscriber has the ability to verify the integrity of a callback payload (i.e. ensure that the message was not tampered with en route) and authenticate the identity of its sender (i.e. ensure that the callback did indeed originate from Smartsheet).

When you create a new [webhook](#webhook-object), it is assigned a randomly generated **sharedSecret** value.  The shared secret is used by Smartsheet to sign callback payloads, and should not be shared with any third parties.

To authenticate a callback request:

1. Calculate the [HMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code) of the webhook's **sharedSecret** and the request body.  This must be done using the SHA-256 cryptographic hash algorithm.

2. Format the calculated value as a string in base 16.

3. Compare your result with the value of the **Smartsheet-Hmac-SHA256** header of the request.

If the values match, you can be sure the request originated from Smartsheet and that the data has not been tampered with.

<aside class="notice">For maximum security, you may also choose to <a href="#reset-shared-secret">reset your webhook's shared secret</a> at periodic intervals.</aside>

# Preventing Infinite Loops

It's possible that an application which subscribes to callbacks (using webhooks) might react to those callbacks by using the API to make additional changes in Smartsheet. 
But, consider the following scenario:

1. **App1** creates a Webhook to monitor **Sheet-A** for changes, specifying an **App-1** URL as the **callbackUrl** for the Webhook.

2. **App-1** updates **Sheet-A** using the API.

3. Smartsheet detects that **Sheet-A** has changed and sends a callback to **App-1** (as the webhook specified).

4. **App-1** processes the callback, and in the course of doing so, updates **Sheet-A** again using the API.

5. Return to Step 3.

To protect against infinite loops like the one outlined above, we've introduced support for a new header that an API client can include with any API request that adds, updates, or deletes data in Smartsheet. 
Here's how it works:

<ul>
<li>An API client includes the <b>Smartsheet-Change-Agent</b> header in any API request that adds, updates, or deletes data in Smartsheet.<br/><br/>
	<ul>
		<li>The header value should be set to a string that the API client will be able to recognize as identifying itself.<br/><br/></li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>If any <a href="#event-callbacks">Event callbacks</a> fire as a result of an API request that contains the <b>Smartsheet-Change-Agent</b> header, the value of the <b>Smartsheet-Change-Agent</b> header will be included in the <a href="#callbackevent-object">callback</a> in the value of the <b>changeAgent</b> attribute.<br/><br/></li>
<li>If a webhook Subscriber receives a <a href="#callbackevent-object">callback</a> that contains the <b>changeAgent</b> attribute, it should evaluate the attribute value:<br/><br/> 
	<ul>
		<li>If the attribute value's comma-delimited list contains the Subscriber API client's change agent value, this indicates that the change which triggered the callback <b>WAS</b> caused by the Subscriber itself, and the Subscriber can choose to ignore the callback, thus preventing an infinite loop.<br/><br/></li>
		<li>Else, the change which triggered the callback was <b>NOT</b> caused by the Subscriber itself, and if the Subscriber is going to subsequently react to the callback by making a change in Smartsheet (via API request), the API client should append a comma and its own identifier to the original attribute value, and pass that value through using the <b>Smartsheet-Change-Agent</b> header of the API request. Doing so will protect against cross-system infinite loops.<br/><br/></li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<aside class="notice">The <b>Smartsheet-Change-Agent</b> header value has a maximum length of 512 characters. If its length exceeds 512 characters, the excess will be trimmed from the front of the string, so that the most recent agent information will remain.</aside>

# Webhook Errors
 
The following table specifies the recommended action for each Smartsheet-specific error code. 
Use this information to implement error handling logic according to the following guidelines:

* If the error code indicates a permanent error condition, do not retry the request.
* If the error code indicates a problem that can be fixed, do not retry the request until the problem has been fixed.
* If the error code indicates a problem that could be overcome by retrying the request after a period of time, retry the request using exponential backoff.

HTTP status code | Smartsheet errorCode | Smartsheet message | Recommended Action |
-----|-----|-----|-----|
400 | 1151 | Scope '{0}', object id {1} was not found. | Do not retry without fixing the problem.
400 | 1152 | Only URLs with a protocol of 'https' are supported for attribute '{0}'. | Do not retry without fixing the problem.
403 | 1153 | This webhook cannot be enabled because access was revoked for the application that created it. | <span class="doNotRetry">Do not retry.</span>
403 | 1154 | Please contact api@smartsheet.com in order to enable this Webhook. | <span class="doNotRetry">Do not retry.</span>
