[Smartsheet](https://www.smartsheet.com/) API 2.0 allows you to programmatically access and manage your organization's Smartsheet data and account information. The API allows you to do the following:

* Read and update sheets
* Manage folders and workspaces
* Administer users and accounts

You can view code examples in the programming language of your choice by clicking the corresponding tab in the dark-blue area in the rightmost pane.

## How Do I Start?

This documentation provides two [Getting Started](#getting-started) tutorials that walk you through making your first API call and interpreting the response to a GET sheet request. You may also want to bookmark or note the following resources:

* [Smartsheet Developer Portal:](http://developers.smartsheet.com) If registering, use a different email address from your paid Smartsheet account so you can test the API and make API calls
* Developer Newsletter (subscribe while at the Developer Portal using the *Get Developer Updates* form)
* [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/smartsheet-api) using the "smartsheet-api" tag
* Additional [Getting Started documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/getting-started)
* Contact us at [api@smartsheet.com](mailto:api@smartsheet.com)

## HTTP and REST

### RESTful Architecture

The REST URL structure follows typical resource-oriented conventions.

To get a list of sheets, use the following:

 `GET https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets`
 
This returns a list of Sheet Objects, where each Sheet has an “id” attribute.

To get details on the sheet with id 123456, use the following:
 
 `GET https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/123456`

This Id pattern is repeated throughout the API. Columns, rows, cells, comments, attachments, or any other data element have a unique Id.

If you don't want to make raw HTTP calls, Smartsheet also has several software development kits (SDKs) that provide a higher level interface for popular programming languages. For more information, see [Sample Code and SDKs.](#sample-code-and-sdks)

### HTTP Verbs

Call the API using the following [standard HTTP methods](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html):

* GET (to retrieve an object or multiple objects in a specific category)
* POST (to create)
* PUT (to modify)
* DELETE

### HTTP Status Codes

<%= partial "snippets/errorHandling.md.erb" %>

<aside class="notice">Smartsheet has custom error codes to help you troubleshoot issues. See the <a href="#complete-error-code-list">Complete Error Code List.</a></aside>

### HTTP Headers

Unless otherwise specified, all API endpoints expect request body data to be in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON), and the response body data is returned as JSON.

The following HTTP request headers may be required, depending on the operation and endpoint being invoked:

Header | Definition | Example |
-----|-----|-----|
*Authorization* | Required for all endpoints, except for POST /token. The access token. | Bearer ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05
*Content-Type* | Required for POST and PUT requests. Defines the structure for the response. | application/json
*Assume-User* | Optional. Allows an admin to act on behalf of the user to make API calls. The email address used to identify the user must be URI-encoded. | jane.doe%40smartsheet.com

### Query Strings

Many API calls can be modified by including one or more of these common query strings: 

Query String | Type | Description | More Info |
-----|-----|-----|-----|
pageSize | Number | Specifies the maximum number of items to return per page, for example, pageSize=25. | [Paging](#paging)
page | String | Specifies which page to return, for example, page=4. | [Paging](#paging)
includeAll | Boolean | If true, includes all results, for example, includeAll=true. | [Paging](#paging)
allowPartialSuccess | Boolean | If true, allows bulk operations to process even if one or more operations are invalid for some reason, for example, allowPartialSuccess=true. | [Bulk Operations](#bulk-operations)
numericDates | Boolean | If true, allows you to input or receive dates in numeric format, for example, numericDates=true. | [Dates and Times](#dates-and-times)
include/exclude | String | When applicable for a specific object, various include or exclude parameters are available, for example, include=formatting. | Object reference or [Formatting](#formatting)

## Authentication and Access Tokens

> Example Request: Authentication and Access Tokens

```shell
curl https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/users/me \
`-H "Authorization: Bearer ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05"
```

```javascript
// Set the access token
var client = require('smartsheet');
var smartsheet = client.createClient({accessToken:'ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05'});

// Get current user
smartsheet.users.getCurrentUser()
	.then(function(userProfile) {
		console.log(userProfile);
	})
	.catch(function(error) {
    	console.log(error);
  	});
```

```csharp
// Set the access token
Token token = new Token();
token.AccessToken = "ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05";
SmartsheetClient smartsheet = new SmartsheetBuilder().SetAccessToken(token.AccessToken).Build();

// Get current user
UserProfile userProfile = smartsheet.UserResources.GetCurrentUser();
```

```java
// Set the access token
Token token = new Token();
token.setAccessToken("ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05");
Smartsheet smartsheet = new SmartsheetBuilder().setAccessToken(token.getAccessToken()).build();

// Get current user
UserProfile userProfile = smartsheet.userResources().getCurrentUser();
```

```python
# Create base client object and set the access token
ss_client = ss_client.Smartsheet('ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05')

# Get current user
user_profile = ss_client.Users.get_current_user()
```

> Example Response:

```json
{
    "email": "john.doe@smartsheet.com",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "id": 48569348493401200
}
```

The Smartsheet API uses OAuth 2.0 for Authentication and Authorization. An HTTP header containing an Access Token is required to authenticate each request. 

If you want to get started quickly, or are developing a standalone application that can run with your credentials, follow these instructions:

1. Open the Account/Personal Settings form and click the "API Access" tab.
2. Click the "Generate new access token" button to obtain an access token.

The access token must be sent with every API call in an HTTP authorization header. Once you have an Access Token, include it in the **Authorization** header for every request you make:

`Authorization: Bearer ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05`

The header name is **Authorization** and the value of the header is **Bearer ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05**. Since the access token is being transmitted in clear text, all API calls are done over HTTPS.

<aside class="warning">The token generated runs with your credentials. Be sure to secure your tokens and do not share tokens with anyone.</aside>

<aside class="notice">If your application requires users to be able to login with their own account, you must implement the full OAuth flow. See the documentation for <a href="#third-party-app-development">Third-party App Development</a> and <a href="http://developers.smartsheet.com/register">Developer Registration</a>.</aside>

## Dates and Times

The Smartsheet API returns all dates and times in the [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) time zone in [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format, that is, YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ.  If a date/time needs to be
displayed to an end-user in their local time zone, you must do the conversion using the user's time zone, which you can obtain by [getting the current user](#get-current-user).

You can optionally choose to receive and send dates/times in numeric format, as milliseconds since the UNIX epoch (midnight on January 1, 1970 in UTC time), using the query string parameter **numericDates** with a value of `true`.
This flag works for any API request. 

## Sheets/Columns/Rows/Cells

Sheets are composed of rows, columns, and cells. A cell is identified by the Id of its row and column. The following table defines these terms and points you to places in this documentation where you can find more information:

UI Element | Description | More Info
-----|-----|-----|
Sheet | A Sheet can exist in a user's **Sheets** folder ([Home](#home)), in a [Folder](#folders), or in a [Workspace](#workspaces). It is comprised of Columns, Rows, and Cells, and may optionally contain Attachments and/or Discussions. | [Sheet Object](#sheet-object)
Column | A Column Object *defines* the type of the column, but does not actually contain cells. The Column Id identifies the cells in a row. | [Column Object,](#column-object) [Column types](#column-types)
Row | A Row is a component of a Sheet or Report. Each Row is composed of a collection of Cells, and may optionally contain Attachments and/or Discussions. | [Row Object](#row-object)
Cell | A Cell is a location within a Sheet that may contain a value. A collection of Cells comprises each Row in a Sheet. | [Cell Object,](#cell-object) [Cell reference](#cell-reference)

## Versioning and Changes

Smartsheet will add new functionality and bug fixes to the API over time. Make sure that your code can handle new JSON properties gracefully. 
Also, make sure your code does not depend on the order in which JSON objects are returned, unless it is explicitly stated in this documentation. 

# Getting Started

## Make Your First API Call

Before you write any code, try executing API requests using a tool like [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/). By taking your code out of the equation, you can isolate troubleshooting to the raw Request and Response.

You must use an access token. See instructions at [Authentication and Access Tokens](#authentication-and-access-tokens). In the examples below, replace this sample token, "ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05", with your actual token value.

To get a list of all your sheets, try the following command:

`curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05" "https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets"`

In Postman, the request looks like this:

<img src="images/postman-sampleb.png" alt="Postman screen shot">

The JSON result should look something like this (after formatting):
<pre class="center-column">
{
	"pageNumber": 1,
	"pageSize": 100,
	"totalPages": 1,
	"totalCount": 2,
	"data": [{
			"id": 6141831453927300,
			"name": "My first sheet",
			"accessLevel": "ADMIN",
			"permalink": "https://app.smartsheet.com/b/home?lx=8enlO7GkdYSz-cHHVus33A",
			"createdAt": "2016-01-28T22:02:35Z",
			"modifiedAt": "2016-08-09T17:50:06Z"
		},
		{
			"id": 6141831453927300,
			"name": "Sheet shared to me",
			"accessLevel": "VIEWER",
			"permalink": "https://app.smartsheet.com/b/home?lx=8enlO7GkdYSz-cHHVus33A",
			"createdAt": "2016-01-28T22:02:35Z",
			"modifiedAt": "2016-08-09T17:50:06Z"
		}
	]
}
</pre>

## How to Read a Sheet Response

Many Smartsheet API operations handle sheets, rows, columns, and cells. Each is identified by an Id and it is important to understand the relationship between these objects. Typically you loop through the columns to determine the Id of the column(s) you are interested in. Then you loop through the rows and contained cells to find actual values. The annotated sample response below illustrates these concepts by calling a very simple sheet called Employee Roster.

<img src="images/Employee_roster.png" alt="Basic sheet with 2 rows and 2 columns" />

Before you begin, you should already have an access token, which you used in the exercise above. Use the same access token for this walkthrough.

1. The first thing you must have is a sheetId. To find a sheetId through the UI, with the sheet open, click Sheet Actions in the left toolbar and select Properties. Note: use [List Sheets](#list-sheets) if you want to do this programmatically.

    <img src="images/sheet-properties.png" alt="Image of the Sheet Properties window" />

2. Copy the sheetId into the API call, GET Sheets, as below:

    `curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05" "https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/6141831453927300"`

3. The sample request and response are displayed below. NOTE: while JSON doesn't have a comment feature, this sample uses comments to help you identify the objects in the response.

<pre class="center-column">
{
	"id": 6141831453927300,                         // This is the Id of the entire sheet
	"name": "My first sheet",
	"columns": [{                                   // Each Column Object connects column title to Id and defines the column details
			"id": 2517104256673668,                 // Column Id identifies cells on a row
			"index": 0,
			"title": "Name",                        // This is the column name as seen in the UI
			"type": "TEXT_NUMBER",
			"primary": true,

			"rowNumber": 1,
			"expanded": true,
			"createdAt": "2017-05-12T16:52:38Z",
			"modifiedAt": "2017-05-22T20:40:14Z",
			"cells": [{                             // Each row contains an array of Cells, which have the actual content
					"columnId": 2517104256673668,   // The column Id can be interpreted by looking at the array of
                                                    // column definitions above. That tells us this is the "Name" column
					"value": "John Doe",            // Actual cell value
					"displayValue": "John Doe"      // How the cell value is displayed in the UI
				},
				{
					"columnId": 7020703884044164,
					"value": 12345,                 
					"displayValue": "12345"
				}

This core hierarchy of Sheet > Column > Row > Cell is essential to working with the Smartsheet API. As your user's sheets grow in complexity, the responses do too. This walkthrough has given you some navigational aid in finding the right value to plug into your API calls. Use the API Reference and the example language tabs to learn more.

# Other Topics

## Access Levels

Sheets, Workspaces, and Templates have an **accessLevel** attribute that describes the current user's access level to that object. 
This corresponds directly to the sharing and access controls of Smartsheet that are available through the Smartsheet UI. 
The **accessLevel** attribute has one of the following values:

Value | Description |
-----|-----|
ADMIN | The user can edit and share the resource, and can alter the structure of the resource as well.
EDITOR | The user can edit the resource, but cannot alter the structure of, delete or share the resource.
EDITOR_SHARE | The same as EDITOR, but with the ability to share the resource to other users.
OWNER | The user has complete control over the resource.
VIEWER | The user has read-only access to the resource.

# Third-party App Development

In addition to being a powerful work management tool, Smartsheet is a powerful application platform. 
 
As a developer, you may be building applications that allow any Smartsheet user to access his or her Smartsheet data. The following sub-sections describe next steps.

## Developer Registration

Third-party app registration and management is available via the Developer Tools. 
To get access to Developer Tools, you must first [register](http://developers.smartsheet.com/register) as a Smartsheet developer. 
Follow the instructions on the registration form to add Developer Tools to an existing Smartsheet account or create a new Smartsheet developer account.
 
Once you complete the developer registration, log in to Smartsheet to access Developer Tools.  

1. Click the **Account** button in the upper-left corner of your Smartsheet screen.
2. Now that you are registered as a Smartsheet developer, click the new **Developer Tools** option in the dropdown menu to open Developer Tools.
3. Before you can register your first app, you must complete your developer profile. Developer profile is a public profile that anyone can access to learn more about you and your applications.
4. Once your developer profile is complete, you can use **Developer Tools** to register and manage your apps.

## Register Your App

To build a third-party app, you must first register it with Smartsheet using Developer Tools:

1. Login to Smartsheet.
2. Click the **Account** button in the upper-left corner of your Smartsheet screen and click **Developer Tools**.
3. Create new app and provide the required information, including name, description, contact info and a redirect URL. Redirect URL (also known as the "callback URL") is the URL in your app where Smartsheet must redirect after authentication is complete.
4. Use the generated app **client id** and **secret** to connect your app to Smartsheet. See [OAuth Flow](#oauth-flow) for details on how to use **client id** and **secret** to do that.

## Access Scopes

To access an end user's Smartsheet data, your application must explicitly ask for specific Access Scopes. 
The Access Scopes enable your app to communicate to the end users what type of operations it is performing. 
Access Scopes do not override existing Access Level restrictions. 
For example, having the Access Scope of WRITE_SHEETS does not allow your app to update a sheet on which the end user has VIEWER access level.
 
The Access Scopes are as follows:

Access Scope | Description |
-----|-----|
ADMIN_SHEETS | Modify sheet structure, including column definition, publish state, etc.
ADMIN_SIGHTS | Modify Sight structure.
ADMIN_USERS | Add and remove users from your Smartsheet organization; create groups and manage membership.
ADMIN_WEBHOOKS | Create, delete. and update webhooks; get all webhooks; reset shared secret. 
ADMIN_WORKSPACES | Create and manage workspaces and folders, including sharing.
CREATE_SHEETS | Create new sheets.
CREATE_SIGHTS | Create new Sights.
DELETE_SHEETS | Delete sheets.
DELETE_SIGHTS | Delete Sight.
READ_CONTACTS | Retrieve contacts.
READ_SHEETS | Read all sheet data, including attachments, discussions, and cell data.
READ_SIGHTS | Read all Sight data.
READ_USERS | Retrieve users and groups for your Smartsheet organization.
SHARE_SHEETS | Share sheets, including sending sheets as attachments.

## OAuth Flow

Your app must implement a 3-legged OAuth flow to retrieve an access token that can be used to access Smartsheet data on behalf of an end user. 
The following sub-sections describe next steps.

### Request Authorization From the User

To request authorization from an end user, direct your user to `https://app.smartsheet.com/b/authorize` with the following parameters through either a `GET` or `POST`. The parameter values must be URL-encoded:

Value | Description |
-----|-----|
response_type<br/>(required) | Must be set to "code".
client_id<br/>(required) | Client Id for your app.
redirect_uri<br/>(optional) | Redirect URL you [registered](#register-your-app) for your app (including protocol, for example, "http://"); if not provided, the redirect URL set during registration is used.
scope<br/>(required) | Space-delimited list of [access scopes](#access-scopes) to which you are asking the user to grant access (note the spaces must be URL-encoded as "%20").
state<br/>(optional) | Arbitrary string returned to your app; intended to be used by you to ensure that this redirect is indeed from an OAuth flow that you initiated.

Here is an example of a URL to which you would send your user as a `GET` request:
 
`https://app.smartsheet.com/b/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=dheu3dmkd32fhxme&scope=READ_SHEETS%20WRITE_SHEETS&state=MY_STATE`
 
If your user has not logged in to Smartsheet, he/she will first be directed to the Smartsheet login page. 
After a successful login, Smartsheet prompts your user to allow or deny the access scopes you requested.

### Obtain the Authorization Code

During the above steps for requesting authorization from the user, if the user clicks "Allow", Smartsheet redirects the user to the **redirect_uri** with the following parameters:

Value | Description |
-----|-----|
code | Authorization code required to obtain access token.
expires_in | Number of seconds code is valid once issued; this is always four minutes - you must obtain an access token within that time.
state | **state** string specified earlier.

If the user clicks "Deny", Smartsheet redirects the user to the **redirect_uri** with the following parameters:

Value | Description |
-----|-----|
error | "access_denied".
state | **state** string specified earlier.

Other errors that may be returned include:

Value | Description |
-----|-----|
unsupported_response_type | response_type must be set to "code".
invalid_scope | One or more of the requested access scopes are invalid. Please check the list of access scopes.

### Obtain an Access Token

> Request an access token:

```shell
curl https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/token \
-d 'grant_type=authorization_code&code={your_code}&client_id={your_client_id}&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}&hash={SHA_256(app_secret|code)}' \
-X POST
```

```javascript
// [todo]
```

```csharp
// [todo]
```

```java
// [todo]
```

```python
# [todo]
```

> Successful Response:

```json
{
   "ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05": "Access Token Value",
   "token_type": "bearer",
   "refresh_token": "Refresh Token Value",
   "expires_in": "# of seconds before token expires"
}
```

> Error Response:

```json
{
   "errorCode": "Smartsheet error number",
   "error": "OAuth error type",
   "error_description": "Error description"
}
```

Once you’ve successfully obtained an authorization code, the next step is to obtain an access token. 
To do so, make a `POST` request to `https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/token` with the following parameters:

Value | Description |
-----|-----|
grant_type<br/>(required) | Must be set to "authorization_code".
client_id<br/>(required) | Client Id for your app.
code<br/>(required) | Authorization code returned in the [previous step](#obtain-the-authorization-code).
redirect_uri<br/>(optional) | Redirect URL [registered](#register-your-app) for your app, including the protocol (for example, "http://"); if not provided, the redirect URL set during registration is used.
hash<br/>(required) | SHA-256 hash of your app secret concatenated with a pipe and the authorization code.  The app_secret is never sent with the request. To obtain an app_secret, see [Register Your App](#register-your-app).

<aside class="notice">The "Get Token" request must have the <b>Content-Type</b> header set to 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'.</aside>

Reminder: you can see what a success call looks like in the dark-blue area in the rightmost pane. 

Possible OAuth error types:

Value | Description |
-----|-----|
invalid_request | The request parameters are invalid or missing.
invalid_client | The client information is invalid. Ensure your client id is correct.
invalid_grant | The authorization code or refresh token is invalid or expired, the redirect_uri does not match, or the hash value does not match the app secret and/or code.
unsupported_grant_type | grant_type must equal "authorization_code" or "refresh_token".

### Refresh an Access Token

> Refresh an access token:

```shell
curl https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/token \
-d 'grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token={your_refresh_token}&client_id={your_client_id}&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}&hash={SHA_256(app_secret|refresh_token)}' \
-X POST
```

```javascript
// [todo]
```

```csharp
// [todo]
```

```java
// [todo]
```

```python
# [todo]
```

> Successful Response:

```json
{
   "1": "Newly refreshed Access Token",
   "expires_in": "# of seconds before token expires",
   "token_type": "bearer",
   "refresh_token": "New refresh token"
}
```

Access tokens expire after 7 days. Use the refresh token to obtain a new access token. 
Once you obtain the new access token, you must use it in place of the old one, which is no longer valid.
 
To do so, make a `POST` request to `https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/token` with the following parameters:

Value | Description |
-----|-----|
grant_type<br/>(required)| Must be set to "refresh_token".
client_id<br/>(required)| Client Id for your app.
refresh_token<br/>(required)| refresh_token value that came with the access token.
redirect_uri<br/>(optional)| Redirect URL [registered](#register-your-app) for your app, including the protocol (for example, "http://").
hash<br/>(required)| SHA-256 hash of your app secret concatenated with a pipe and the refresh token value. To obtain an app_secret, see [Register Your App](#register-your-app).

<aside class="notice">The "Refresh Token" request must have the <b>Content-Type</b> header set to 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'.</aside>

### Get Basic User Info
Once you have obtained an access token on behalf of the user, you can fetch basic information (including user Id, name, etc.) about the caller using the [Get Current User](#get-current-user) operation.

# Work at Scale 

## Bulk Operations

The Smartsheet API supports a number of bulk operations that can operate on multiple objects.  Unlike single-object operations, bulk operations allow you to create, update, or delete
multiple objects in a single request. For example, if you want to update 10 rows within a sheet, do so using a single [Update Rows](#update-rows) request, rather than executing 10 separate requests - one for each row.

### Optional Bulk Operations

Several endpoints support *optional* bulk `POST` operations which exist alongside the standard single-object `POST`.  For these endpoints, you may pass in either a single object or an array of objects.
Depending on what was passed in, the [Result Object](#result-object) returned contains either a single object or an array.  An example optional bulk operation is [POST /favorites](#add-favorites): you can
pass in a single [Favorite Object](#favorite-object) to create a single favorite, or an array of Favorite objects to create multiple favorites in a single request.  Endpoints which support bulk operations are
noted as such in the API reference documentation.

**NOTE**: Most `POST` operations fail when attempting to create a single object which already exists (for example, favorites, shares, group members).  However, for the corresponding bulk operations, these endpoints do *not*
return an error if one or more items in the array already exist.  Existing items are simply ignored, and the [Result Object](#result-object) returned omits them.

### Partial Success

In general, the default behavior for bulk operations is to fail outright if any of the objects in the request are invalid for some reason.  If successful, Smartsheet creates/updates/deletes all objects in the request;
if not, no objects are changed.

However, there are some operations that support *partial success*, which means the operation still succeeds even if one or more of the objects in the request fails for some reason (for example, an object is invalid).  Partial success is 
*not* the default mode for an operation and you must explicitly enable it by using a query string parameter.  This is noted in the documentation for operations that support partial success.

<%= PARTIAL_SUCCESS %>

## Paging

The Smartsheet API contains a number of *index endpoints* (typically denoted in the documentation with titles beginning with "Get All" or "List") which return arrays of objects.
Examples include `GET` [/users](#list-users), [/sheets](#list-sheets), [/sheets/{sheetId}/columns](#list-columns), and many others.  These endpoints all support pagination, meaning
you can retrieve paged subsets of results, enabling you to process potentially large result sets in smaller chunks.

### Paging Query String Parameters
Index endpoints all support pagination via the following optional query string parameters:

Value | Type | Description |
-----|-----|-----|
**pageSize** 	| number  | The maximum number of items to return per page.  Unless otherwise stated for a specific endpoint, defaults to **100** if not specified.
**page**		| number  | Which page to return.  Defaults to **1** if not specified.  If you specify a value greater than the total number of pages, the last page of results is returned.
**includeAll**  | Boolean | If true, include all results, that is, do not paginate.  Mutually exclusive with **pageSize** and **page** (they are ignored if **includeAll**=true is specified).

<aside class="notice">Most index endpoints default to a page size of 100 results.  If you want all results at once, you must specify the <code class="prettyprint">includeAll=true</code> query string parameter.</aside>

### Paged Responses

Index endpoints all return paged responses via an **IndexResult** Object which provides paging metadata that can be used to navigate the full set of pages in the result set:

<%= partial "snippets/indexResult_object.md.erb" %>

## Rate Limiting

<%= partial "snippets/rateLimiting.md.erb" %>

# <span class="customTOCSectionHeading">API Reference</span>

# Attachments

Attachments can exist on a [Comment](#comments) (that is, within a Discussion), on a [Row](#rows), or on a [Sheet](#sheets).

## <%= OBJECTS %>

### Attachment Object

> Example Attachment Object:

```json
{
    "id": 4539352454850436,
    "name": "at3.pdf",
    "url": "https://www.example.com",
    "attachmentType": "FILE",
    "mimeType": "application/pdf",
    "urlExpiresInMillis": 120000,
    "sizeInKb": 56,
    "createdBy": {
        "name": "Jane Roe",
        "email": "jane.roe@company.com"
    },
    "createdAt": "2017-06-09T17:41:05Z"
}
```

     |     |     |
-----|-----|-----|
**id** | number | Attachment Id
**name** | string | Attachment name
**url** | string | Attachment temporary URL (files only)
**urlExpiresInMillis** | number | Attachment temporary URL time to live (files only) 
**attachmentType** | string | Attachment type (one of FILE, GOOGLE_DRIVE, LINK, BOX_COM, DROPBOX, EVERNOTE, EGNYTE, ONEDRIVE)
**attachmentSubType** | string | Attachment sub type, valid only for either GOOGLE_DRIVE attachments or EGNYTE attachments:<ul><li>possible values for GOOGLE_DRIVE attachments: DOCUMENT, SPREADSHEET, PRESENTATION, PDF, DRAWING</li><li>possible values for EGNYTE attachments: FOLDER</li></ul>
**createdAt** | timestamp | A timestamp of when the attachment was originally added
**createdBy** | [User](#user-object) | User Object containing name and email of the creator of this attachment
**mimeType** | string | Attachment MIME type (PNG, etc.)
**parentType** | string | The type of object the attachment belongs to. One of "SHEET", "ROW", or "COMMENT"
**parentId** | number | The id of the parent 
**sizeInKb** | number | The size of the file, if the attachmentType is FILE  

## Post an Attachment

Like the Smartsheet Web app, the Smartsheet API allows uploading files to Sheets, Rows and Comments. 
You can upload a file by performing either a *simple upload* or a *multipart upload*. 

A [simple upload](#simple-uploads) allows you to add a single file attachment to the specified object. 
For example, you can perform a simple upload to upload a file to a [sheet](#attach-file-to-sheet), [row](#attach-file-to-row), or [comment](#attach-file-to-comment). 

A [multipart upload](#multipart-uploads) allows you to add a single file attachment to the specified object (that is, attach a file to a [sheet](#attach-file-to-sheet), [row](#attach-file-to-row), or [comment](#attach-file-to-comment)), or to create an object and attach a file using a single request. 
For example, you can perform a multipart upload to [create a new Comment](#add-comment) that contains a single file attachment or to [add a new Discussion to a Sheet](#create-discussion-on-sheet) that contains a single file attachment.

<aside class="notice">Important Notes:<ul><li>Max file size for uploads through the API is currently limited to 30mb.</li><li>Posting an attachment is a resource-intensive operation and incurs 10 additional requests against the rate limit.</li></ul></aside>

### Multipart Uploads

A multipart upload request allows you to add a single file attachment to the specified object (that is, attach a file to a [sheet](#attach-file-to-sheet), [row](#attach-file-to-row), or [comment](#attach-file-to-comment)), or to create an object and upload a file using a single request. 
For example, you can perform a multipart upload to [create a new Comment](#add-comment) that contains a single file attachment or to [add a new Discussion to a Sheet](#create-discussion-on-sheet) that contains a single file attachment.

<aside class="notice">Most programming languages have libraries that can be used to assemble multipart requests.</aside>

A multipart upload request must include the following HTTP headers:

     |     |
-----|-----|
**Content-Type** | Must be set to `multipart/form-data`, and include the boundary string that separates the parts in the request payload.
**Content-Length** | The length of the request payload.

The request body of a multipart upload request contains one or more *parts*, each part containing either JSON or a file to upload. 
The request body must contain at least one part. 
Each part must start with the boundary string specified in the **Content-Type** request header, and must contain the following part headers:

     |     |
-----|-----|
**Content-Disposition** | Contains the following semicolon-delimited items:<ul><li>`form-data`</li><li>`name=`"*partname*"</li><li>`filename=`"*filename*" (only required for file parts)</li></ul><b><i>Note</i></b>: Values specified in the Content-Disposition header must be URL-encoded.
**Content-Type** | The content type of the part: `application/json` for JSON objects, or the applicable MIME type for file parts

The last part in the request must be followed by the boundary string, followed by two hyphens.

The documentation for each operation that supports multipart uploads specifies the number and names of parts that are expected for the operation. 
File parts must have the part name "file", and documentation for operations which allow for JSON object parts specify the required part name for the JSON part.

The following example shows a multipart upload request that creates a Comment containing the specified text and file attachment:

`POST https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/4509093797881732/discussions/2889925487028100/comments`  
`Authorization: Bearer ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05`  
`Content-Length: 29008`  
`Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----gU8h01zAAp3LagBr`  

`------gU8h01zAAp3LagBr`  
`Content-Disposition: form-data; name="comment"`  
`Content-Type: application/json`  

`{ "text": "Please review the attached image." }`  
`------gU8h01zAAp3LagBr`  
`Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="picture.jpg"`  
`Content-Type: image/jpeg`  

*< Binary content for file >*  
`------gU8h01zAAp3LagBr--`

### Simple Uploads

A [simple upload](#simple-uploads) allows you to add a single file attachment to the specified object. 
For example, you can perform a simple upload to upload a file to a [sheet](#attach-file-to-sheet), [row](#attach-file-to-row), or [comment](#attach-file-to-comment). 

To perform this kind of upload, you must set specific headers to tell Smartsheet about the file. The following three headers are required: 

     |     |
-----|-----|
**Content-Disposition** | `attachment` to tell the API that a file is in the body of the POST request, followed by a semicolon, followed by `filename=` and the URL-encoded filename in quotes
**Content-Type** | Can be left blank if it is not known (but must be present); Smartsheet makes its best guess based on the extension of the file. 
**Content-Length** | Must be set to the size of the file, in bytes. For example to determine file size using in UNIX: <p>`$ ls -l ProgressReport.docx`<br/>`5463 ProgressReport.docx`</p>

The following example request shows a simple upload that adds a file attachment to a Sheet:

`POST https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/4509093797881732/attachments`  
`Authorization: Bearer ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05`  
`Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="ProgressReport.docx"`  
`Content-Type: application/msword`  
`Content-Length: 5463`  

*< Binary content for file >*  

As shown in this example, the contents of the file is included in the body of the `POST` request. In most programming languages, this is done by reading the file from an input stream and writing it out to the output stream of the HTTP request.

-----|-----|-----|
**columnId** | number | The Id of the column that the cell is located in
**columnType** | string | See type definition on the [Column Object](#column-object).<br/>Only returned if the [**include**](#row-include-flags) query string parameter contains **columnType**.
**value** | string,<br/>number,<br/>or Boolean | A string, a number or a Boolean value -- depending on the cell type and the data in the cell.  An empty cell returns no value. See [Cell Reference](#cell-reference).

**overrideValidation** | Boolean | (Admin only) Flag indicating whether the cell value can contain a value outside of the validation limits (value = `true`). When using this parameter, you must also set **strict** to `false` to bypass value type checking. This property is honored for POST or PUT actions that update rows.
**format** | string | The format descriptor (see [Formatting](#formatting))<br/>Only returned if the [**include**](#row-include-flags) query string parameter contains **format** and this cell has a non-default format applied.
**conditionalFormat** | string | The format descriptor describing this cell's conditional format (see [Formatting](#formatting)).<br/>Only returned if the [**include**](#row-include-flags) query string parameter contains **format** and this cell has a conditional format applied.
**strict** | Boolean | Set to **false** to enable lenient parsing. Defaults to **true**. <%= REQUEST_ONLY_ATTRIBUTE %> See [Cell Value Parsing](#cell-value-parsing) for more information about using this attribute. 
**image** | [Image](#image-object) | The image that the cell contains.<br/>Only returned if the cell contains an image.

## Update Cells

To update the Cells in a Sheet, use the [Update Rows](#update-rows) operation.

## <%= RELATED %>

### Cell Links

Creating or updating cell links via the **cell.linkInFromCell** attribute is a special operation. 
A given row or cell update operation may contain only link updates, or no link updates. 
Attempting to mix row/cell updates with cell link updates results in error code 1115. 
Additionally, a [cell link](#celllink-object) can only be added to an *existing* cell, so the **cell.linkInFromCell** attribute is not allowed when POSTing a new row to a sheet.
 
When creating a cell link, **cell.value** must be null (the data is pulled from the linked cell).
 
A cell may not contain both a hyperlink and a cell link, so **hyperlink** and **linkInFromCell** may never both be non-null at the same time.

[Cell Objects](#cell-object) retrieved through the Smartsheet APIs have two main attributes representing cell values: **Cell.value**, and
**Cell.displayValue**.  A third attribute, **Cell.objectValue** is currently used only for adding and updating predecessors.
An empty cell returns no value.

**Cell.displayValue** is always a **string** and is only returned for certain column types (see below).  It represents the formatted value as it should
be displayed to an end-user.  For example, if a TEXT_NUMBER column is formatted as a US Dollar currency, its **value** may be a number
like 1234.5678, but its **displayValue** would be "$1,234.57".

**Cell.value** represents a cell's raw value and can be one of the following primitive JSON types: **string**, **number**, or **Boolean**,
depending on the column type.  An empty cell returns no value. Complex types are represented as strings, formatted as described below:

<% PROJECT_COLUMN_HELP_URL = "https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/765737-project-sheet-columns-start-date-end-date-duration-complete-and-predecessors" %>

| Column Type | Possible Types for Cell.value | Returns Cell.displayValue?
|-------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------
| TEXT_NUMBER	| **string**: free-form text values<br/>**number**: numeric values											| Yes: same as **value** for strings; for number values, the number with formatting applied.
| CONTACT_LIST	| **string**: an email address representing a contact, or a free-form text value.							| Yes: same as **value** for free-form strings; for contacts, the contact's name if any, else their email address.
| DATE			| **string**: a date in [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format, or a free-form text value.<br/>**number**: see [Dates and Times](#dates-and-times) for how to request dates to be returned as numbers. | No.
| PICKLIST		| **string**: one of the picklist's column options, or a free-form text value.<br/>**number**: numeric values| Yes: same as **value** for strings; for number values, the number with formatting applied.
| CHECKBOX		| **Boolean**: `true` if the checkbox is checked, `false` if unchecked, no value if the cell hasn't been touched yet.<br/>**string**: a free-form text value.| No.
| DURATION		| **string**: a duration value such as "4d 6h 30m" in the user's locale, or a free-form text value.<br/>See the [Help Center](<%= PROJECT_COLUMN_HELP_URL %>) for more information on durations.| Yes: same as **value**
| PREDECESSOR	| **string**: a comma-delimited predecessor list such as "12FS +3d 4h, 14SS", or a free-form text value.<br/>See the [Help Center](<%= PROJECT_COLUMN_HELP_URL %>) for more information on predecessors.| Yes: same as **value**
| ABSTRACT_DATETIME | **string**: a project date and time in [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format, or a free-form text value.<br/>**number**: see [Dates and Times](#dates-and-times) for how to request dates to be returned as numbers. | No.

**Cell.objectValue** is an object representation of a cell's value and is currently used for adding or updating predecessor cell values.
It provides a more "programmer friendly" format for assembling predecessors. To update a cell's predecessors, set objectValue to a
[PredecessorList Object](#predecessorlist-object) containing [Predecessor Objects](#predecessor-object).

#### Cell Value Parsing

The flexibility in cell value data types is a powerful feature in the Smartsheet application, but at the same time, it poses a challenge
for an API in terms of parsing. Being too flexible will likely result in unexpected behavior. For instance, if you write code
to post a Date value to a Smartsheet and the API operation succeeds,  you might assume that the date value you sent was interpreted
as date. What happens if you posted your date in the wrong format? Do you really want Smartsheet to keep the malformed date
as a Text value? Probably not.
 
To address this problem, the Smartsheet API employs a simple scheme to indicate whether you want a more predictable and strict
interface or a more flexible one. By default, a cell value is expected to conform to "strict" rules for the type of the cell's column.
If an input value doesn't conform, the API returns [error code 1042](#400-level-error-codes).

If, however, you want the same flexibility as the Smartsheet Web app, you can disable the strict rules, and we’ll do our best to make
sense of it. To enable lenient parsing simply include `"strict" : false` in the [Cell Object](#cell-object) in your request body.

<aside class="notice">How does strict cell value parsing compare to cell validation settings? Strict cell value parsing determines how string values are parsed. It is set on a per-call basis. In contrast, cell validation is part of the column definition. The overrideValidation property is restricted to sheet admins and does **not** override strict parsing.</aside>

The parsing rules for the various column types are as follows:

**TEXT_NUMBER**:

     |     |
-----|-----|
*Strict* | All numeric and text values are valid and are interpreted literally.
*Lenient* | All numeric and text values are valid. Formatted numbers passed as text values, such as currencies ("$5,000"), percentages ("50%"), or decimals ("100.5") are parsed to their numeric equivalents, based on the locale of the Access Token owner,  with the proper formatting enabled for the cell.

<aside class="notice">The Smartsheet application only supports numeric values in the range -9007199254740992 to 9007199254740992. If using strict parsing, any numeric value outside that range results in <a href="#complete-error-code-list">error code 1148</a>. If using lenient parsing, the value is silently converted to text.</aside>

**PICKLIST**:

     |     |
-----|-----|
*Strict* | The value must be a string and must be one of the options for the Picklist.
*Lenient* | All numeric and text values are valid. Formatted numbers are parsed like TEXT_NUMBER formatted numbers.

**DATE**:

     |     |
-----|-----|
*Strict* | The value must be a string value and a valid ISO 8601 date (YYYY-MM-DD).
*Lenient* | Smartsheet attempts to convert the string value to date using ISO 8601 date format, as well as several locale-specific date formats. If the value is a parsable date format, Smartsheet recognizes the date and stores it as such. All other values are simply text values.

<aside class="notice">You may use the query string parameter <b>numericDates</b> with a value of <code>true</code> to enable strict parsing of dates in numeric format.  See <a href="#dates-and-times">Dates and Times</a> for more information.</aside>

**CONTACT_LIST**:

     |     |
-----|-----|
*Strict* | The value must be a valid email address. If "displayValue" is set, Smartsheet uses that as the name, otherwise if Smartsheet finds a match among the the Access Token owner's contacts, Smartsheet associates this cell with that existing contact.
*Lenient* | If the value is a valid email address, Smartsheet handles it the same way as Strict. If not, Smartsheet saves the value as a text value.

<aside class="notice">See <a href="#contact-list-columns">Contact List Columns</a> for more information.</aside>

**CHECKBOX**:

     |     |
-----|-----|
*Strict* | Only Boolean values (true or false) are valid.
*Lenient* | Boolean values and string values of 'true' and "false" are handled the same as Strict. All other values are saved as text values.

**DURATION**:

     |     |
-----|-----|
*Strict* | Only valid duration strings in the user's locale are valid.  Information on duration strings can be found in the [Help Center](<%= PROJECT_COLUMN_HELP_URL %>).
*Lenient* | Numeric values are treated as duration values in days.  String values which are valid duration strings in the user's locale are treated as durations, and any other values are treated as free-form text values.

<aside class="notice">You may use the query string parameter <b>projectParseLocale</b> with a <a href="#server-information">supported locale string</a> to force parsing in the specified locale (for example, using <code>en_US</code> lets you send in English values regardless of the user's locale)</aside>

**PREDECESSOR**:

The Smartsheet API doesn't support parsing of predecessor strings, so strict and lenient parsing don't apply to predecessors.  Instead, you can set the **objectValue** attribute to a [PredecessorList Object](#predecessorlist-object) containing
[Predecessor Objects](#predecessor-object). To set a cell in a predecessor column to a non-predecessor string value, simply set **objectValue** to a string.

**ABSTRACT_DATETIME**:

     |     |
-----|-----|
*Strict* | The value must be a string value and a valid ISO 8601 date and time.
*Lenient* | Smartsheet attempts to convert the string value to date using ISO 8601 date format, as well as several locale-specific date formats. If the value is a parsable date format, Smartsheet recognizes the date and stores it as such. All other values are simply text values.

<aside class="notice">You may use the query string parameter <b>numericDates</b> with a value of <code>true</code> to enable strict parsing of dates in numeric format.  See <a href="#dates-and-times">Dates and Times</a> for more information.</aside>

#### Contact List Columns

With columns of type CONTACT_LIST, cells’ "value" and "displayValue" attributes are treated independently. 
The contact’s email address is represented by **value**, while the contact’s name (and the value displayed in the cell in the Smartsheet app) is represented by **displayValue**.
 
When creating or updating cells for a contact list column, the **displayValue** attribute works as follows:

* If **displayValue** is non-null and non-empty, the Smartsheet cell displays the value provided.
* If **displayValue** is an empty string, the Smartsheet cell displays the email address.
* If **displayValue** is null or absent, Smartsheet makes a best guess effort at filling it in with a contact’s name based on the email address.

### Hyperlinks

You can create and modify [hyperlinks](#hyperlink-object) by using any API operation that creates or updates cell data. 
When creating or updating a hyperlink, **cell.value** may be set to a string value or null. 
If null, the cell's value is derived from the hyperlink: 

* If the hyperlink is a URL link, the cell's value is set to the URL itself.
* If the hyperlink is a sheet, report, or Sight link, the cell's value is set to the sheet, report, or Sight name.

Downloading a cell image is a multi-step process. This sample downloads a cell image to a local file. The cell is specified by sheet Id, row Id, and column Id.

Click the appropriate language tab in the rightmost pane to see sample code.

**Step 1. Locate the cell**

Get the desired row, then locate the desired cell based on the column Id.

**Step 2. Obtain the image Id**

Cell images are identified by an image Id, which is stored in a cell Image Object. (The image Id is the "key" to the image and should be kept secure.)

When a user uploads an image to a cell, Smartsheet uses the original file name as the image "Alt text." This example uses that Alt text value as the local file name.

**Step 3. Obtain a temporary image URL**

The POST /imageurls command creates a temporary URL that you can use to download the image. The URL expires after a short time, which is reported in the response.

**Step 4. Download the image**

Once you have the URL, issue a standard HTTP GET to download the image and save as a local file.

`PUT /sheets/{sheetId}/columns/{columnId}`

Updates properties of the column, moves the column, and/or renames the column.

**Notes:**

* You cannot change the type of a Primary column.
* While dependencies are enabled on a sheet, you can't change the type of any special calendar/Gantt columns.
* If the column type is changed, all cells in the column are converted to the new column type and column validation is cleared.
* Type is optional when moving or renaming, but required when changing type or dropdown values.

### Column Types

Smartsheet supports the following standard column types, which are represented in a [Column Object](#column-object) with a **type** attribute set to one of the following:

Column Type | Column.type Value | Notes |
------------|--------------------------|-------|
Text/Number		| TEXT_NUMBER	|
Contact List	| CONTACT_LIST	| List containing contacts or roles for a project. **NOTE:** You can use the [contactOptions](#contactoption-object) property to specify a pre-defined list of values for the column, which can also become lanes in card view. 
Date			| DATE			|
Dropdown List	| PICKLIST		| Custom, RYG, Harvey Ball, Priority types, etc.
Checkbox 		| CHECKBOX		| Checkbox, star, and flag types
Duration		| DURATION		| **Only for dependency-enabled project sheets**<br/>The API does not support setting a Column to this type. (This can only be done through the Smartsheet Web app when configuring a project sheet.)
Predecessor		| PREDECESSOR	| **Only for dependency-enabled project sheets**<br/>The API does not support setting a Column to this type, or updating data in a column of this type. (This can only be done through the Smartsheet Web app when configuring a project sheet.) 
Date/Time 		| ABSTRACT_DATETIME | Represents a project sheet's Start and End dates.<br/>**Only for dependency-enabled project sheets**<br/>The API does not support setting a Column to this type. (This can only be done through the Smartsheet Web app when configuring a project sheet.) Additionally, the API does not support updating data in the End Date column under any circumstance, and does not support updating data in the Start Date column if Predecessor is set for that row.
Date/Time		| DATETIME		| Used only by the following System-generated columns: <ul><li>Created (Date) (**Column.systemColumnType** = "CREATED_DATE")</li><li>Modified (Date) (**Column.systemColumnType** = "MODIFIED_DATE")</li></ul>

<aside class="notice">See the <a href="#cell-reference">Cell Reference</a> section for information on getting and setting cell values for the different column types.</aside>

#### Symbol Columns

In addition to the basic column types above, the Smartsheet app also supports columns that display symbols. These are simply specialized columns of type PICKLIST or CHECKBOX,
whose **[symbol](#column-object)** attribute is set to one of the values below:

**Symbols for CHECKBOX columns:**

Value | Example |
-----|-----|
FLAG | <img src="images/img_pl_flagc.png" alt="A flag symbol" /> |
STAR | <img src="images/img_pl_starc.png" alt="A star symbol" /> |

**Symbols for PICKLIST columns:**

Value | Example |
-----|-----|
ARROWS_3_WAY | <img src="images/img_pl_arrows3.png" alt="An arrows_3_way symbol" /> |
ARROWS_4_WAY | <img src="images/img_pl_arrows4.png" alt="An arrows_4_way symbol" /> |
ARROWS_5_WAY | <img src="images/img_pl_arrows5.png" alt="An arrows_5_way symbol" /> |
DECISION_SHAPES | <img src="images/img_pl_decisionshapes.png" alt="A decision_shapes symbol" /> |
DECISION_SYMBOLS | <img src="images/img_pl_decisionsymbols.png" alt="A decision_symbols symbol" /> |
DIRECTIONS_3_WAY | <img src="images/img_pl_directions3.png" alt="A directions_3_way symbol" /> |
DIRECTIONS_4_WAY | <img src="images/img_pl_directions4.png" alt="A directions_4_way symbol" /> |
EFFORT | <img src="images/img_pl_effort6Three.png" alt="An effort symbol" /> |
HARVEY_BALLS | <img src="images/img_pl_harvey5.png" alt="A harvey_balls symbol" /> |
HEARTS | <img src="images/img_pl_heart6Three.png" alt="A hearts symbol" /> |
MONEY | <img src="images/img_pl_money6Three.png" alt="A money symbol" /> |
PAIN | <img src="images/img_pl_pain6.png" alt="A pain symbol" /> |
PRIORITY | <img src="images/img_pl_priority.png" alt="A priority symbol" /> |
PRIORITY_HML | <img src="images/img_pl_priorityhml.png" alt="A priority_hml symbol" /> |
PROGRESS | <img src="images/img_pl_progress5Half.png" alt="A progress symbol" /> |
RYG | <img src="images/img_pl_ryg.png" alt="An RYG symbol" /> |
RYGB | <img src="images/img_pl_rygb.png" alt="An RYGB symbol" /> |
RYGG | <img src="images/img_pl_rygg.png" alt="An RYGG symbol" /> |
SIGNAL | <img src="images/img_pl_signal5.png" alt="A signal symbol" /> |
SKI | <img src="images/img_pl_difficulty4.png" alt="A ski symbol" /> |
STAR_RATING | <img src="images/img_pl_star6Three.png" alt="A star_rating symbol" /> 
VCR | <img src="images/img_pl_decisionvcr.png" alt="A VCR symbol" /> |
WEATHER | <img src="images/img_pl_weather5.png" alt="A weather symbol" /> |
 
<aside class="notice">The Smartsheet grid user interface presents several row attributes and features (for example, row number, attachments, discussions, row action indicator) visually as columns.  The API does not consider these to be columns, and does not return or otherwise expose them as columns.  The only columns returned by the API are user data columns.</aside>

#### System Columns

In addition to the standard column types and symbols, Smartsheet has a number of *system columns*, which represent data that is
filled in by Smartsheet and whose values cannot be changed by the user. These columns are represented with standard
[column types](#column-types), with the **[Column.systemColumnType](#column-object)** attribute set to one of the following:

Column.systemColumnType Value | Column Type | Notes
-----|-----|-----|
MODIFIED_DATE | DATETIME
MODIFIED_BY | CONTACT_LIST
CREATED_DATE | DATETIME
CREATED_BY  | CONTACT_LIST
AUTO_NUMBER | TEXT_NUMBER | Columns of this system column type include an [AutoNumberFormat Object](#autonumberformat-object) that describes the mask used to generate the value.

`GET /home`

Gets a nested list of all Home Objects, including Sheets, Workspaces, Folders, Reports, Templates, and Sights, as shown on the Home tab.

     |     |
-----|-----|
<%= SCOPE %> | READ_SHEETS
<%= HEADERS %> | <%= HEADER_AUTH %>
<%= PARAMETERS %> | **include** (optional) -- a comma-separated list of optional elements to include in the response:<ul><li>ownerInfo - owner's email address and user Id for each sheet</li><li>source - the [source](#source-object) for any sheet that was created from another sheet or template</li></ul>
<%= RETURNS %> | [Home Object](#home-object), populated according to the **include** parameter

## <%= RELATED %>

### Home Folders

For details about working with Folders in the user's **Sheets** folder (that is, at the Home level), see [Folders](#folders).

### Home Sheets

For details about working with sheets in the user's **Sheets** folder (that is, at the Home level), see [Sheets](#sheets).

# Reports

A Report is a filtered view of the data from one or more Sheets. Like a Sheet, a Report is comprised of Columns, Rows, and Cells, and may optionally contain Attachments and/or Discussions.

## <%= OBJECTS %>

### Report Object

> Example Report Object:

```json
{
    "id": 4583173393803140,
    "name": "My Report",
    "totalRowCount": 4,
    "accessLevel": "OWNER",
    "permalink": "https://app.smartsheet.com/b/home?lx=pWNSDH9itjBXxBzFmyf-5w",
    "createdAt": "2012-07-24T18:22:29-07:00",
    "modifiedAt": "2012-07-24T18:30:52-07:00",
    "columns": [],
    "rows": []
}
```

Extends the [Sheet Object](#sheet-object), adding the following:

     |     |     |
-----|-----|-----|
**sourceSheets** | [Sheet](#sheet-object)[] | Array of Sheet Objects (without rows), representing the sheets that rows in the report originated from.  Only included in the [Get Report](#get-report) response if the **include** parameter specifies "sourceSheets".

### ReportCell Object

Extends the [Cell Object](#cell-object), adding the following: 

     |     |     |
-----|-----|-----|
**virtualColumnId** | number | The virtual Id of the cell's column. This property refers to the cell's parent column in the Report, while the **columnId** property refers to the cell's parent column in its originating source Sheet.


### ReportColumn Object

Extends the [Column Object](#column-object), adding the following: 

     |     |     |
-----|-----|-----|
**virtualId** | number | The virtual Id of this report column
**sheetNameColumn** | Boolean | Returned only for the special "Sheet Name" report column (value = 'true')

A report column is a "virtual" column, in that it appears identical to source sheet columns, but is in fact a different column belonging to the report. 
[Cells](#reportcell-object) in the report refer to this column via their **virtualColumnId** attribute, and to their actual column from their source sheet via their **columnId** attribute.

### ReportRow Object

Extends the [Row Object](#row-object), adding the following: 

     |     |     |
-----|-----|-----|
**sheetId** | number | The Id of the Sheet from which the Row originates

### ReportPublish Object 

     |     |     |
-----|-----|-----|
**readOnlyFullEnabled** | Boolean | If `true`, a rich version of the report is published with the ability to download row attachments and discussions.
**readOnlyFullUrl** | string | URL for 'Read-Only Full' view of the published report<br/>Only returned in a response if **readOnlyFullEnabled** = true.
**readOnlyFullAccessibleBy** | string | Flag to indicate who can access the 'Read-Only Full' view of the published report:<ul><li>If "ALL", it is available to anyone who has the link.</li><li>If "ORG", it is available only to members of the report owner's Smartsheet organization.</li></ul>Only returned in a response if **readOnlyFullEnabled** = true.

A Row is comprised of a collection of Cells, and may optionally contain Attachments and/or Discussions.

### Row Attachments

For details about working with a Row's attachments, see [Attachments](#attachments).

### Row Cells

For details about working with a Row's cells, see [Cells](#cells).

For details about working with images in cells, see [Cell Images](#cell-images).

### Row Discussions

For details about working with a Row's discussions, see [Discussions](#discussions).

### Row Include Flags

Endpoints which return rows (for example, [get sheet](#get-sheet), [get row](#get-row)) support the optional **include** query string parameter. If specified, the value of the **include** parameter is 
a comma-delimited list of flags that indicate additional attributes to be included in each [Row Object](#row-object) within the response.

Include Flag | Notes |
-------------|-------|
**discussions**	| Includes row **discussions** array.<br/>To include discussion attachments, both **attachments** and **discussions** must be present in the include list.
**attachments**	| Includes row **attachments** array.<br/>To include discussion attachments, both **attachments** and **discussions** must be present in the include list.
**format**		| Includes **format** attribute on the row and its cells.  See [Formatting](#formatting).
**filters**		| Includes **filteredOut** attribute indicating if the row should be displayed or hidden according to the sheet's filters.
**columnType**	| Includes **columnType** attribute in the row's [cells](#cell-object) indicating the type of the column the cell resides in.
**rowPermalink** | Includes **permalink** attribute that represents a direct link to the [row](#row-object) in the Smartsheet application.
**rowWriterInfo** | Includes **createdBy** and **modifiedBy** attributes on the row, indicating the row's creator, and last modifier.
**objectValue** | Includes **objectValue** attribute on cells containing values. For more information see [Cell Reference](#cell-reference).

### Row Location

When using the [Add Rows](#add-rows) operation to insert new rows into a sheet or the [Update Rows](#update-rows) to move rows in a sheet, 
the following "location-specifier" [Row](#row-object) attributes can be used to specify where the rows get added or moved to in the sheet:

* toTop
* toBottom
* above
* siblingId
* parentId
* indent (applicable when updating a row only)
* outdent (applicable when updating a row only)

The following table describes which *location-specifier* Row attributes should be set to implement various actions.

Action | Row attributes
-------|--------
Add or move the Row to the top of the Sheet. | **toTop** = `true`
Add or move the Row to the bottom of the Sheet. | **toBottom** = `true`
Add or move the Row directly above the specified sibling Row (at the same hierarchical level). | **above** = `true`<br/>**siblingId** = (Id of sibling row)
Add or move the Row directly below the specified sibling Row (at the same hierarchical level). | **siblingId** = (Id of sibling row)
Add or move the Row so that it is the first child row of the specified parent Row. | **parentId** = (Id of parent row)
Add or move the Row so that it is the last child row of the specified parent Row. | **parentId** = (Id of parent row)<br/>**toBottom** = `true`
Indent an existing Row. | **indent** = (number of level to indent, minimum of 1)
Outdent an existing Row. | **outdent** = (number of level to outdent, minimum of 1)

<aside class="notice"><b>Troubleshooting errors:</b>&#160;&#160;If you receive an Error response when attempting to (individually) move both a parent Row and its child Rows in a single request, try achieving the objective by using two separate requests: 1) Move parent Row. 2) Move child Rows.</aside>

500-level error codes indicate there is some kind of permanent error.

HTTP status code | Smartsheet errorCode | Smartsheet message
-----|-----|-----|
500 | 1170 | The sheet referenced by this widget is unavailable or deleted.
500 | 1171 | The report referenced by this widget is unavailable or deleted.
500 | 1172 | The referenced cell is unavailable or deleted.
500 | 4000 | An unexpected error has occurred. Please contact api@smartsheet.com for assistance.
503 | 4001 | Smartsheet.com is currently offline for system maintenance. Please check back again shortly.
500 | 4002 | Server timeout exceeded. Request has failed.
500 | 4004 | An unexpected error has occurred. Please retry your request. If you encounter this error repeatedly, please contact api@smartsheet.com for assistance.<br/><br/>**Or**<br/><br/>Request failed because sheetId {0} is currently being updated by another request that uses the same access token. Please retry your request once the previous request has completed.

# Formatting

Formatting data can optionally be included for columns, rows, and cells by adding the "include=format" query string parameter to any API operation that returns any of those objects (for example, `GET /sheets/{sheetId}`, `GET sheets/{sheetId}/rows/{rowId}`, etc.).  When this parameter is included, objects that contain non-default formatting include a **format** property.  Objects that do not have any non-default format settings applied exclude this property.
 
Because the amount of format data in a large sheet can potentially be very large in itself, for bandwidth reasons, format data is represented by a compact format descriptor string.  The format descriptor takes the form of a comma-separated list of numeric values.  These values represent indexes into pre-defined format lookup tables which can be retrieved using the `GET /serverinfo` operation.

## Row & Column Format

Setting the format of a row or column through the API simply sets the baseline format for new cells in that row or column.  It does not affect existing cells.
 
The equivalent API action for what happens when you highlight a column or row in the Smartsheet Webapp and set a format (for example, bold) would be to update the format of a column or row (via `PUT /sheets/{sheetId}/rows/{rowId}` or `PUT /sheets/{sheetId}/columns/{columnId}`), and update the format for every cell in that row or column.  All of the cells in a row can be updated in one operation (`PUT /sheets/{sheetId}/rows/{rowId}`), but there is currently no way to update all of the cells in a column in one operation.  This will be addressed in a future version of the API.

## Format Descriptor

The format descriptor contains 16 comma-separated numeric indexes.  Each index represents a format style whose value can be found in one of the lookup tables in the [FormatTables Object](#formattables-object).

**Format Descriptor Element #** | **Format Style** | **FormatTables Lookup Table Property** |
-----|-----|-----|
0 | Font Family | fontFamily
1 | Font size | fontSize
2 | Bold | bold
3 | Italic | italic
4 | Underline | underline
5 | Strikethrough | strikethrough
6 | Horizontal alignment | horizontalAlign
7 | Vertical alignment | verticalAlign
8 | Text color | color
9 | Background color | color
10 | Taskbar color | color
11 | Currency | currency
12 | Decimal count | decimalCount
13 | Thousands separator | thousandsSeparator
14 | Number format | numberFormat
15 | Text wrap | textWrap

<aside class="notice">Formats which have not been explicitly set are omitted in the descriptor string.  For example, a cell which has been set to bold and italic, but has no other formats applied to it, would have a format descriptor of ",,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,".</aside>

<aside class="notice">As a convenience, the FormatTables Object contains a <b>defaults</b> property which is a format descriptor that describes which formats the Smartsheet Web app displays for unset formats.  Your application can use these values to display unformatted cells identically to the Smartsheet Web app.</aside>

## FormatTables Object

The FormatTables Object is retrieved via the `GET /serverinfo` operation and contains all of the lookup tables that the [Format Descriptor](#format-descriptor) indexes refer to, as well as a property called **defaults**, which is a Format Descriptor that describes which formats the Smartsheet Web app displays for unset formats.
 
<aside class="notice">Indexes and their values are guaranteed never to change or be removed for a given major API version.  However, new values could potentially be added to the ends of lookup tables.<br/><br/>Because of this possibility, your code should handle the case where a cell might contain a format index value greater than the size of a lookup table your app has loaded.  Your application should check for that case and reload the format tables if necessary.</aside>

# <span class="customTOCSectionHeading">Deprecations</span>

Smartsheet occasionally deprecates APIs to indicate that those APIs should no longer be used in active development. 
Deprecated APIs typically remain present and usable for a reasonable period of time following the release in which they were deprecated, but may be removed entirely from a future version of the API. 
You should never use deprecated APIs in new development, and if you have existing code that uses deprecated APIs, Smartsheet recommends that you update that code as soon as possible. 

# Endpoints

This section specifies the endpoints and parameters that have been deprecated in version 2.0 of the Smartsheet API.

## Deprecated Endpoints

The following endpoints have been deprecated in version 2.0 of the Smartsheet API.

Operation | Deprecated Endpoint | Replaced by 
-------- | -------- | ----- | -----------------
 Delete Row (singular) | DELETE /sheets/{sheetId}/rows/{rowId} | new endpoint for [Delete Rows](#delete-rows)
 Send Row (singular) | POST /sheets/{sheetId}/rows/{rowId}/emails | new endpoint for [Send Rows](#send-rows-via-email)
 
## Deprecated Parameters

Operation | Deprecated Parameter | Replaced by
-------- | -------- | --------
[Create Child Folder](#create-child-folder) | include | new endpoint for [Copy Folder](#copy-folder)
[Create Sheet](#create-sheet) | include | new endpoint for [Copy Sheet](#copy-sheet)
[Create Workspace](#create-workspace) | include | new endpoint for [Copy Workspace](#copy-workspace)

# Objects

This section specifies the objects and attributes that have been deprecated in version 2.0 of the Smartsheet API.

## Deprecated Objects

No objects have been deprecated in version 2.0 of the Smartsheet API.

## Deprecated Attributes

The following attributes have been deprecated in version 2.0 of the Smartsheet API.

Object | Deprecated Attribute | Replaced by
-------- | -------- | --------
[Folder Object](#folder-object) | fromId | new endpoint for [Copy Folder](#copy-folder)
[Sheet Object](#sheet-object) | fromId | new endpoint for [Copy Sheet](#copy-sheet)
[Workspace Object](#workspace-object) | fromId | new endpoint for [Copy Workspace](#copy-workspace)

# Troubleshooting

Should you encounter issues with the Smartsheet API while building an integration using a particular programming language (ex: Java, C#, PHP, Python, etc.), keep the following troubleshooting techniques in mind.

1. Try executing the same API Request using a tool like [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/). By taking your code out of the equation, you can isolate troubleshooting to the raw Request / Response.
  * If you receive a similar error when you execute the Request using cURL or Postman, this suggests an issue with the Request format or contents. Once you have the Request working in cURL or Postman, update your code accordingly.
  * If you can execute the Request successfully using cURL or Postman, but not via your code, this suggests that the Request your code is sending is somehow different than what you intend. Compare the (successful) Request from cURL or Postman with the (unsuccessful) Request that your code generates. (See step #2 below.)
2. Examine the Request that your code is sending (including the HTTP verb, URI, headers, and Request body) and the Response that it's receiving back from Smartsheet (including the HTTP status code, headers, and response body).
  * If you've implemented Request / Response logging in your application, inspect the full trace of Request and Response in the log file. Compare the Request that your application is logging with the (successful) Request from cURL or Postman, and update your code to correct any discrepancies.
  * Alternatively, you may choose to use a tool like [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler) or [Charles HTTP Proxy](https://www.charlesproxy.com/) to inspect the full trace of Request and Response as it goes across the wire. Compare the Request trace that your application generates with the (successful) Request from cURL or Postman, and update your code to correct any discrepancies.

# Intro to Webhooks

<%= WEBHOOKS_INTRO %> 

At a high-level, it works like this:

<ol>
	<li><span class="customInstructionsHeading">Your application subscribes to <a href="#event-callbacks">callbacks</a>.</span><br/>First, subscribe to event notifications (callbacks) by creating one or more webhooks.  You can create a webhook manually via the API or have your application create a webhook dynamically.  Each webhook must specify:
		<ul>
			<li>Which Smartsheet object to monitor for events</li>
			<li>Which events in that object should trigger a callback</li>
			<li>The HTTPS URL (that is, "<b>callback URL</b>") where Smartsheet should send callbacks when any of the specified events occur within the scope of the specified Smartsheet object. (Note: Smartsheet webhooks do not support callbacks to servers using self-signed certificates)</li>
		</ul> 
		<br/>
		
		<b>Webhook examples in plain English:</b> 
		<ul>
			<li><i>"When any changes occur in Sheet_A, send a callback to https://www.myapp.com/abc"</i></li>
			<li><i>"When a new row is added to Sheet_B, send a callback to https://www.myapp.com/def"</i></li>
			<li><i>"When a cell value is changed in Sheet_C, send a callback to https://www.myapp.com/ghi"</i></li>
		</ul>
		<br/>
	</li>
	<li><span class="customInstructionsHeading">When any of the specified events occur within an object that is being monitored by a webhook, Smartsheet sends an <code>HTTP POST</code> (that is, "callback") to the <b>callback URL</b> that is associated with the Webhook.</span><br/>
		<ul>
			<li><i>Note:</i> The callback payload is a "skinny" payload -- it indicates which objects changed and the type of events that occurred, but does not contain any data from the objects themselves.</li>
		</ul> 
		<br/>
	</li>
	<li><span class="customInstructionsHeading">Your application receives, acknowledges, and processes callbacks.</span><br/>Your application receives the <code>HTTP POST</code>, acknowledges the callback by responding with HTTP status 200, and processes the callback. 
	Because the callbacks are "skinny", make one or more requests to the Smartsheet API to retrieve the actual data associated with the change.
	</li>
</ol>

## Webhook Management

Webhooks are created and managed by using the Smartsheet API. See [Webhooks API Reference](#webhooks) for details about the related API operations. 

## Webhook Ownership & Access

Webhooks can be created and managed via [Direct API Access](#webhooks-reference) or by a [third-party app](#third-party-app-development). 

A webhook that is created via Direct API Access:

* is owned by the User who created it
* can be managed only by the User who created it
* is not affected if the access token that was used to create it is revoked, as long as the User remains active

A webhook that is created by a [third-party app](#third-party-app-development):

* is owned by the User who authorized the third-party app (and is associated with the third-party app)
* can be managed by the third-party app (as long as it maintains authorization) OR by the User who owns it
* is permanently disabled if the third-party app's permissions are revoked

## Webhook Scope & Events

A webhook monitors the specified **scope** for the specified **events**. 

A [Webhook's](#webhook-object) **scope** attribute indicates the scope of the subscription. It is specified when [creating a webhook](#create-webhook), and cannot subsequently be changed. 

* Currently, "sheet" is the only supported value for the **scope** attribute. 
* Future releases of webhooks will support additional scopes such as "org", "folder", "workspace", etc.

A [Webhook's](#webhook-object) **event** attribute indicates the set of events that a webhook is subscribed to (that is, which events trigger a callback).

* Events are represented as a dot-separated string in the format "*object*.*event*", where an asterisk (&#42;) can be used to represent "all objects" or "all events".
* Currently, "&#42;.&#42;" is the only supported value for the **events** attribute. This indicates a subscription to all objects in the scope, and all events for those objects.
* Future releases of webhooks will support more specific events such as "sheet.updated", "row.deleted", "column.created", etc.

<span class="customSubHeading">Example</span>

Consider a [Webhook](#webhook-object) with the following attribute values:

* **scopeObjectId** = 12345678901234
* **scope** = "sheet" 
* **events** = "&#42;.&#42;" 

This webhook monitors the specified Sheet (id: 12345678901234) for all types of events. For example, if a row is added to the sheet, cell values are updated in the sheet, a column is deleted from the sheet, etc., a callback would be sent to the webhook's **callbackUrl**.

# Creating a Webhook

An API client can create a webhook by using the [Create Webhook](#create-webhook) operation. A newly created webhook is disabled by default.
After successfully creating a webhook, the API client must subsequently initiate and complete the [verification process](#webhook-verification) before the webhook is enabled. 
The following diagram illustrates the process of creating and enabling a Webhook. 

<img src="images/v4-CreateAndEnableWebhook.png" alt="Workflow to create a Webhook" />

<span class="customSubHeading">Step-by-Step:</span>

The process occurs synchronously:

1. API Client submits a [Create Webhook](#create-webhook) request.

2. Smartsheet creates the webhook, but does not initially enable the webhook (`enabled: false` and `status: "NEW_NOT_VERIFIED"`).

3. To initiate the verification process, the API Client submits an [Update Webhook](#update-webhook) request to specify `enabled: true`. (*Note*: The API Client does not receive a response to this request until the Verification process (steps 4 and 5) has completed.)

4. When Smartsheet receives the request to enable the webhook, it sends a [Verification Request](#webhook-verification) to the Subscriber (that is, to the `callbackUrl` that the API Client specified in the **Create Webhook** request). 
The request specifies a unique random value in the **Smartsheet-Hook-Challenge** header and contains only `challenge` and `webhookId` in the request body. The `challenge` value is a repeat of the header value for API clients that don't interpret header values.

5. The Subscriber responds to the Verification Request by echoing back the same unique random value in the **Smartsheet-Hook-Response** header of the response.

6. Once the Subscriber has successfully acknowledged the Verification Request, Smartsheet enables the webhook and responds to the API Client's **Update Webhook** request to confirm that the webhook has been enabled (`enabled: true` and `status: "ENABLED"`). 

## Webhook Verification

> Verification Request (from Smartsheet):

```test
POST [callbackUrl]
Smartsheet-Hook-Challenge: d78dd1d3-01ce-4481-81de-92b4f3aa5ab1 
{ 
    "challenge": "d78dd1d3-01ce-4481-81de-92b4f3aa5ab1",
    "webhookId": 2674017481058180
}
```

> Verification Response (by Subscriber):

```test
HTTP status: 200 OK
Smartsheet-Hook-Response: d78dd1d3-01ce-4481-81de-92b4f3aa5ab1 
```

When an API Client attempts to enable a webhook, Smartsheet sends a verification request to the webhook's **callbackUrl** to verify that the Subscriber expects and is able to successfully receive callbacks. 
The request specifies a unique random value in the **Smartsheet-Hook-Challenge** header and contains a JSON object in the request body with only `challenge` and `webhookId` attributes in the request body. The `challenge` attribute is a repeat of the header value for API clients that don't interpret header values.

* To verify the webhook, the Subscriber's response to the Verification Request must return a 200 HTTP status code and must echo back the same unique random value in the **Smartsheet-Hook-Response** header of the response. Once Smartsheet receives this verification response, the webhook is enabled (`enabled: true` and `status: "ENABLED"`).

* If the Subscriber does not successfully respond to the verification request, the webhook remains disabled (`enabled: false` and `status: "DISABLED_VERIFICATION_FAILED"`).

When a webhook is initially [created through the API](#create-webhook), the response contains the webhook's Id.  If you wish to guarantee that your server only receives callbacks for webhooks that you created,
you can check the verification request's `webhookId` attribute against your list of created webhook Ids.  If the Id is not in the list, return a response with a non-200 status code (for example, 403 Forbidden),
and the webhook that initiated the verification request is disabled as described above.

<aside class="notice"><b>IMPORTANT</b>: ONGOING VERIFICATION. Once a webhook has been enabled, Smartsheet sends a verification request to the webhook's <b>callbackUrl</b> once every 100 callbacks. The Subscriber should respond to the verification request as described above -- failure to do so results in the webhook being disabled (<code>enabled: false</code> and <code>status: "DISABLED_VERIFICATION_FAILED"</code>).</aside>

# Webhook Status

A [Webhook](#webhook-object) object's **enabled** attribute indicates whether a webhook is enabled or disabled, while the **status** attribute describes the *reason* that the webhook is enabled or disabled.

<aside class="notice"><b>Note:</b><ul><li>When a Webhook's <b>enabled</b> attribute is set to <code>true</code>, Smartsheet is monitoring for the specified events and sends a <a href="#event-callbacks">callback</a> to the <b>callbackUrl</b> when the events occur.</li><li>When a Webhook's <b>enabled</b> attribute is set to <code>false</code>, Smartsheet is NOT monitoring for the specified events and does NOT send a callback to the <b>callbackUrl</b> when the events occur. Depending on the value of the <b>status</b> attribute, it may be possible to (re-)enable the Webhook. (See below for details).</li></ul></aside>

The following table lists all possible combinations of **enabled** and **status** attribute values.

Webhook.enabled | Webhook.status | Meaning | Notes
----- | ----- | ------ | -----
true  | ENABLED | Webhook is active. | 
false | NEW_NOT_VERIFIED | Webhook has been created but is not enabled because it has not yet been verified. |  Owner can re-enable the webhook by using the [Update Webhook](#update-webhook) operation to set **enabled** to `true`. Once the subscriber successfully acknowledges the [verification request](#webhook-verification), the webhook is enabled.
false  | DISABLED_BY_OWNER | Webhook has been disabled by the owner. | Owner can re-enable the webhook by using the [Update Webhook](#update-webhook) operation to set **enabled** to `true`. Once the subscriber successfully acknowledges the [verification request](#webhook-verification), the webhook is enabled.
false  | DISABLED_VERIFICATION_FAILED | Webhook verification has failed. |  Owner can re-enable the webhook by using the [Update Webhook](#update-webhook) operation to set **enabled** to `true`. Once the subscriber successfully acknowledges the [verification request](#webhook-verification), the webhook is enabled.
false  | DISABLED_CALLBACK_FAILED | Webhook has been disabled because callback was not successfully delivered to the Callback URL. |  Owner can re-enable the webhook by using the [Update Webhook](#update-webhook) operation to set **enabled** to `true`. Once the subscriber successfully acknowledges the [verification request](#webhook-verification), the webhook is enabled.
false  | DISABLED_APP_REVOKED | Webhook has been disabled because the third-party app associated with the webhook has had its access revoked. | This is a terminal state (that is, webhook in this state cannot be re-enabled, and attempts to do so will result in error code 1153). If the third-party app's access is subsequently restored, it must create new webhooks.
false  | DISABLED_SCOPE_INACCESSIBLE | Webhook has been disabled because its owner lost access to the corresponding data in Smartsheet (either because the object was deleted or sharing permissions were revoked). | Webhook is automatically re-enabled if access to data is restored (for example, if deleted object is restored or sharing permissions are restored).
false  | DISABLED_ADMINISTRATIVE | Webhook has been disabled by Smartsheet support. | A webhook in this state can only be re-enabled by Smartsheet (contact <a href="mailto:api@smartsheet.com">api@smartsheet.com</a>).  Attempting to re-enable a webhook in this state results in error code 1154.

# Webhook Callbacks

A "callback" is the notification that Smartsheet sends to a webhook's **callbackUrl**. There are two types of callbacks:

* [**Event** callback](#event-callbacks): Alerts the subscriber when the specified events have occurred in Smartsheet. This is the most common type of callback.

* [**Status Change** callback](#status-change-callbacks): Alerts the subscriber that a webhook has been automatically disabled due to loss of access or automatically re-enabled due to restoration of access.

A Subscriber has the ability to verify the integrity of a callback payload (that is, ensure that the message was not tampered with en route) and authenticate the identity of its sender (that is, ensure that the callback did indeed originate from Smartsheet). 
For more information, see [Authenticating Callbacks](#authenticating-callbacks-optional).

## Event Callbacks

> Example - Event callback (row created):

```json
{
    "nonce": "4b2ed20d-6f00-4b0c-8fac-082182aa9aac",
    "timestamp": "2015-10-27T17:04:23.795+0000",
    "webhookId": 4503604829677444,
    "scope": "sheet",
    "scopeObjectId": 4509506114742148,
    "events": [
        {
            "objectType": "sheet",
            "eventType": "updated",
            "id": 4509506114742148,
			"userId": 9007194052434043,
			"timestamp": "2015-10-27T17:03:15.000+0000"
        },
        {
            "objectType": "row",
            "eventType": "created",
            "id": 7129509179746180,
			"userId": 9007194052434043,
			"timestamp": "2015-10-27T17:03:15.000+0000"
        }
    ]
}
```

Smartsheet sends an Event callback to notify the Subscriber when the specified events occur in Smartsheet.

<aside class="warning">Any events that occur while a webhook is disabled are NOT communicated via callback if/when webhook is enabled.</aside>

<span class="customSubHeading">Callback Acknowledgement</span>

The Subscriber must respond to an event callback with a 200 [HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#2xx_Success) to acknowledge that the callback was received. 

<span class="customSubHeading">Retry Logic</span>

If the Subscriber fails to respond with a 200 status, depending on the response, Smartsheet may retry delivery up to 14 times. (The first 7 retry attempts occur with a frequency that's determined using exponential backoff; thereafter, retry attempts occur once every three hours until all retries have been exhausted.)

Subscriber response | Will be retried?
----- | -----
HTTP 201 through 299 | No
HTTP 309 through 399 | No
HTTP 400 through 499 (except 410) | Yes
HTTP 410 | No
HTTP 500 through 599 | Yes
Any other HTTP status | No
Request timeout | Yes

If the response is not retriable or retry attempts have been exhausted, the webhook is disabled (`enabled: false` and `status: "DISABLED_CALLBACK_FAILED"`).
A webhook in this state can be re-enabled if the subscriber completes the verification process. (See [Webhook Status](#webhook-status) for details.)

## Status Change Callbacks

> Status Change callback (access lost):

```json
{
    "nonce" : "20d4d741-6224-446f-b9c4-bf7802326192",
    "timestamp" : "2015-10-27T14:48:40.214+0000",
    "webhookId": 2674017481058180,
    "scope" : "sheet",
    "scopeObjectId" : 3407658024757124,
    "newWebhookStatus" : "DISABLED_SCOPE_INACCESSIBLE"
}
```

> Status Change callback (access restored):

```json
{
    "nonce" : "20d4d741-6224-446f-b9c4-bf7802326192",
    "timestamp" : "2015-10-27T14:48:40.214+0000",
    "webhookId": 2674017481058180,
    "scope" : "sheet",
    "scopeObjectId" : 3407658024757124,
    "newWebhookStatus" : "ENABLED"
}
```

If a webhook's owner loses access to the object that a webhook is monitoring (either because the object was deleted or the webhook owner's access to the object was revoked in Smartsheet), 
Smartsheet automatically disables the webhook and sends a Status Change callback to alert the Subscriber of this change in status. 
The **newWebhookStatus** attribute indicates that the webhook is now disabled (because the scope is inaccessible).

If the webhook owner's access to the object is subsequently restored, 
Smartsheet automatically re-enables the webhook and sends a Status Change callback to alert the Subscriber of this change in status. 
The **newWebhookStatus** attribute indicates that the webhook is now enabled.

## Authenticating Callbacks (optional)

> Calculating an HMAC

```shell
# See programming language tabs for language-specific examples.
```

```java
private static final String HMAC_SHA256_ALGORITHM="HmacSHA256";
private static final int HMAC_RADIX=16;

private String calculateHmac(String sharedSecret, String callbackBody)throws GeneralSecurityException{
    Mac mac = Mac.getInstance(HMAC_SHA256_ALGORITHM));
    mac.init( new SecretKeySpec(sharedSecret.getBytes(), HMAC_SHA256_ALGORITHM));

    byte[]rawHmac = mac.doFinal(callbackBody.getBytes());
    return new BigInteger(1, rawHmac).toString(HMAC_RADIX);
}
```

A Subscriber has the ability to verify the integrity of a callback payload (that is, ensure that the message was not tampered with en route) and authenticate the identity of its sender (that is, ensure that the callback did indeed originate from Smartsheet).

When you create a new [webhook](#webhook-object), it is assigned a randomly generated **sharedSecret** value.  The shared secret is used by Smartsheet to sign callback payloads, and should not be shared with any third parties.

To authenticate a callback request:

1. Calculate the [HMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code) of the webhook's **sharedSecret** and the request body.  This must be done using the SHA-256 cryptographic hash algorithm.

2. Format the calculated value as a string in base 16.

3. Compare your result with the value of the **Smartsheet-Hmac-SHA256** header of the request.

If the values match, you can be sure the request originated from Smartsheet and that the data has not been tampered with.

<aside class="notice">For maximum security, you may also choose to <a href="#reset-shared-secret">reset your webhook's shared secret</a> at periodic intervals.</aside>

# Preventing Infinite Loops

It's possible that an application which subscribes to callbacks (using webhooks) might react to those callbacks by using the API to make additional changes in Smartsheet. 
But, consider the following scenario:

1. **App1** creates a Webhook to monitor **Sheet-A** for changes, specifying an **App-1** URL as the **callbackUrl** for the Webhook.

2. **App-1** updates **Sheet-A** using the API.

3. Smartsheet detects that **Sheet-A** has changed and sends a callback to **App-1** (as the webhook specified).

4. **App-1** processes the callback, and in the course of doing so, updates **Sheet-A** again using the API.

5. Return to Step 3.

To protect against infinite loops like the one outlined above, Smartsheet introduced support for a new header that an API client can include with any API request that adds, updates, or deletes data in Smartsheet. 
Here's how it works:

* An API client includes the **Smartsheet-Change-Agent** header in any API request that adds, updates, or deletes data in Smartsheet.
  * The header value should be set to a string that the API client recognizes as identifying itself.
* If any [Event callbacks](#event-callbacks) fire as a result of an API request that contains the **Smartsheet-Change-Agent** header, the value of the **Smartsheet-Change-Agent** header is included in the [callback](#callbackevent-object) in the value of the **changeAgent** attribute.
* If a webhook Subscriber receives a [callback](#callbackevent-object) that contains the **changeAgent** attribute, it should evaluate the attribute value:
  * If the attribute value's comma-delimited list contains the Subscriber API client's change agent value, this indicates that the change which triggered the callback **WAS** caused by the Subscriber itself, and the Subscriber can choose to ignore the callback, thus preventing an infinite loop.
  * Else, the change which triggered the callback was **NOT** caused by the Subscriber itself, and if the Subscriber is going to subsequently react to the callback by making a change in Smartsheet (via API request), the API client should append a comma and its own identifier to the original attribute value, and pass that value through using the **Smartsheet-Change-Agent** header of the API request. Doing so protects against cross-system infinite loops.

<aside class="notice">The <b>Smartsheet-Change-Agent</b> header value has a maximum length of 512 characters. If its length exceeds 512 characters, the excess is trimmed from the front of the string, so that the most recent agent information remains.</aside>

# Webhook Errors
 
The following table specifies the recommended action for each Smartsheet-specific error code. 
Use this information to implement error handling logic according to the following guidelines:

* If the error code indicates a permanent error condition, do not retry the request.
* If the error code indicates a problem that can be fixed, do not retry the request until the problem has been fixed.
* If the error code indicates a problem that could be overcome by retrying the request after a period of time, retry the request using exponential backoff.

HTTP status code | Smartsheet errorCode | Smartsheet message | Recommended Action |
-----|-----|-----|-----|
400 | 1151 | Scope '{0}', object id {1} was not found. | Do not retry without fixing the problem.
400 | 1152 | Only URLs with a protocol of 'https' are supported for attribute '{0}'. | Do not retry without fixing the problem.
403 | 1153 | This webhook cannot be enabled because access was revoked for the application that created it. | <span class="doNotRetry">Do not retry.</span>

**sharedSecret** | string | New value for the shared secret

## Webhook Object

     |     |     |
-----|-----|-----|
**id** | number | Webhook Id
**name** | string | Webhook name
**apiClientId** | string | API Client Id corresponding to third-party app that created the Webhook. Read-only. Only present if webhook was created by third-party app.
**apiClientName** | string | API Client Name corresponding to third-party app that created the Webhook. Read-only. Only present if webhook was created by third-party app.
**scope** | string | Scope of the subscription. Currently, the only supported value is "sheet". Specified when a webhook is created and cannot be changed.
**scopeObjectId** | number | Id of the object that is subscribed to. Specified when a webhook is created and cannot be changed.
**events** | string[] | Array of the events that are subscribed to. Currently, must be an array of size 1 that contains the string value "&#42;.&#42;", which means "all objects" and "all events".
**callbackUrl** | string | HTTPS URL where callbacks are sent.<br/><br/>**Note:** Smartsheet webhooks do not support callbacks to servers using self-signed certificates. The callback server must be using a signed certificate from a certificate authority.
