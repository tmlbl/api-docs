# Overview

## Introduction

> **Base URL**:  https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0

The Smartsheet API provides programmatic access to Smartsheet features and data. 
In designing the API, our goal was to make it simple, intuitive, and predictable. 
We do our best to adhere to common open and widely accepted standards, including REST for access, JSON format for the data, and OAuth for Authentication and Authorization. 
This API assumes a good working knowledge of the Smartsheet application UI, concepts and terminology.

## RESTful Architecture

```apires
Resources:

/favorites
/folders
/groups
/home
/reports
/search
/serverinfo
/sheets
/sheets/{id}/rows
/sheets/{id}/columns
/sheets/{id}/attachments
/sheets/{id}/discussions
/templates
/token
/users
/workspaces
```

Everything in Smartsheet is represented as an object with a defined structure. 
For example, the "Home" object contains a list of your Sheets, Folders, Reports, Templates, and Workspaces, and a Sheet object contains Columns, Rows, Attachments, and Discussions. 
All aspects of Smartsheet are modeled as structured objects.

URL structure follows typical resource-oriented conventions. For example, to get a list of sheets, use `GET https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets`. 
This will return a list of Sheet objects, where each Sheet will have an "id" attribute. 
To get details on a particular sheet, use `GET https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/123456`, where 123456 is the "id" of the Sheet you want. 
Similarly, to share a sheet, `POST` a Share object to `https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/123456/shares`.

## HTTP Standards

All actions taken through the API are done via HTTP using [standard HTTP methods](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html): GET (to retrieve an object), POST (to create), PUT (to modify), and DELETE. 
[Standard HTTP Response codes](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html) are used to indicate success and error conditions.

## Input / Output Format

Unless otherwise specified, all API endpoints expect request body data to be in [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON), and the response body data is returned as JSON.
The following HTTP request headers may be required, depending on the operation and endpoint being invoked:

     |     |
-----|-----|
*Content-Type* | For POST and PUT requests, must be set to the appropriate value (typically `application/json`).  Ignored for GET and DELETE requests.
*Accept*       | Optional; if not specified, `*/*` is assumed (i.e. any response type is accepted), else it must match the output of the invoked endpoint (typically `application/json`).
 
<aside class="notice">Some of the data returned by the Smartsheet API is user-generated content. Caution should be taken to ensure that the user-generated content is consumed safely in any external system to avoid introducing vulnerabilities.</aside>

## Example Requests & Responses

With every API operation we provide a sample request and a sample response. 
The sample requests shown on the **cURL** tab use the command line data transfer tool [cURL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL). 
Alternatively, you could also test API requests / responses using a Chrome extension like [Advanced REST Client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo/) or [POSTMAN](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm).

## Versioning and Changes

**Non-breaking changes**: We will be adding new functionality and bug fixes to the API over time. 
You should expect to see new endpoints or new attributes for existing objects. 
Such changes will not result in a new API version.  Please make sure that your code can handle new attributes gracefully. 
Also, please make sure your code does not depend on the order in which records are returned, unless it is explicitly stated in this documentation.  

**Breaking changes**: We intend to maintain the current API version for the foreseeable future. 
If and when we decide to add functionality that breaks the contract of the current API, we will publish it with a new version number, so as to keep the existing API functionality backwards compatible.

**Deprecations**: Smartsheet occasionally deprecates APIs to indicate that those APIs should no longer be used in active development. 
Deprecated APIs typically remain present and usable for a reasonable period of time following the release in which they were deprecated, but may be removed entirely from a future version of the API. 
You should never use deprecated APIs in new development, and if you have existing code that uses deprecated APIs, we recommend that you update that code as soon as possible. 
For a list of Smartsheet API 2.0 deprecations, see [Deprecations](#deprecations).

# API Fundamentals

## Authentication

The Smartsheet API utilizes OAuth 2.0 for Authentication and Authorization. 
An **Authorization** HTTP header containing an Access Token is required to authenticate requests. 
Access Tokens can be acquired in one of two ways:
<ul>
<li>via the Smartsheet UI ([User-generated Access Tokens](#user-generated-access-tokens)) </li>
<li>via oAuth 2.0 (see [Third-party Access Tokens](#third-party-access-tokens))</li>
</ul> 

### User-generated Access Tokens

Smartsheet users can easily generate Access Tokens by logging in to their Smartsheet account. 
Once a token is generated, it can be used in a script or custom application, or with an API integration service like Zapier, to access any Smartsheet data which the token owner already can access in the application. 
See [Direct API Access](#direct-api-access) for more information on user-generated tokens.

### Third-party Access Tokens

Third-party developers are able to build applications that can acquire Access Tokens using OAuth 2.0. 
See [Third Party App Development](#third-party-app-development) for more information.

## Access Levels

Throughout the API we have "Share" objects that represent the shared user's access level. 
Also, on Sheets, Workspaces and Templates, there is an **accessLevel** attribute that describes the current user's access level to that object. 
This corresponds directly to the sharing and access controls of Smartsheet that are available through the Smartsheet UI. 
The **accessLevel** attribute has one of the following values:

     |     |
-----|-----|
VIEWER | The user has read-only access to the resource.
EDITOR | The user can edit the resource, but cannot alter the structure of, delete or share the resource.
EDITOR_SHARE | The same as EDITOR, but with the ability to share the resource to other users.
ADMIN | The user can edit and share the resource, and can alter the structure of the resource as well.
OWNER | The user has complete control over the resource.

## Rate Limiting

In order to prevent abuse and undue stress on the Smartsheet servers, the API has a rate limiting feature that restricts users to **300** requests per minute per Access Token. 
Certain resource intensive operations, such as attaching a file and getting cell history, count as 10 requests to prevent abuse of these operations. 
We reserve the right to enforce this limit depending on the load on our systems. 
If and when the limit is enforced, any requests that exceed this limit will be rejected with an **HTTP 503** error code, with the Smartsheet error code **4003**. 
Please design your applications assuming that the stated limit will be enforced.

## Errors

[Standard HTTP Response codes](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html) are used to indicate success and error conditions. Generally, they will follow this pattern:

     |     |
-----|-----|
2xx | Request was successful
4xx | Problem with request (malformed or missing a parameter or access denied)
5xx | Request was properly formatted, but the operation failed on Smartsheet’s end

**Smartsheet HTTP codes**:

     |     |
-----|-----|
200 | OK
400 | BAD REQUEST
401 | NOT AUTHORIZED
403 | FORBIDDEN
404 | NOT FOUND
405 | METHOD NOT SUPPORTED
500 | INTERNAL SERVER ERROR
503 | SERVICE UNAVAILABLE

All errors will also be accompanied by JSON-formatted error objects, containing a descriptive message. For example, doing a `GET` on a non-existent sheet at `https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/123456` will result in a response code of **404**, indicating the resource was not found. The body of the response will include an Error object:

{<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"errorCode": 1006,<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"message": "Not Found"<br/>
}

## Column Types

Smartsheet supports the following standard column types, which are represented in a [Column object](#column-object) with a **type** attribute set to one of the following:

Column Type | Column.type Value | Notes |
------------|--------------------------|-------|
Text/Number		| TEXT_NUMBER	|
Contact List	| CONTACT_LIST	|
Date			| DATE			|
Dropdown List	| PICKLIST		| Custom, RYG, Harvey Ball, Priority types, etc.
Checkbox 		| CHECKBOX		| Checkbox, star, and flag types
Duration		| DURATION		| **Only for dependency-enabled project sheets**<br/>This type can only be set through the Smartsheet application when configuring a project sheet.
Predecessor		| PREDECESSOR	| **Only for dependency-enabled project sheets**<br/>This type can only be set through the Smartsheet application when configuring a project sheet.
Date/Time 		| ABSTRACT_DATETIME | Represents a project sheet's Start and End dates.<br/>**Only for dependency-enabled project sheets**<br/>This type can only be set through the Smartsheet application when configuring a project sheet.

<aside class="notice">See the <a href="#cell-values">Cell Values</a> section for information on getting and setting cell values for the different column types.</aside>

### Symbol Columns

In addition to the basic column types above, the Smartsheet app also supports columns that display symbols. These are simply specialized columns of type PICKLIST or CHECKBOX,
whose **[symbol](#column-object)** attribute is set to one of the values below:

**Symbols for CHECKBOX columns:**

<% CHECKBOX_SYMBOL_LIST = "<ul><li>STAR</li><li>FLAG</li></ul>" %>

<%= CHECKBOX_SYMBOL_LIST %>

**Symbols for PICKLIST columns:**

<% PICKLIST_SYMBOL_LIST = "<ul><li>HARVEY_BALLS</li><li>PRIORITY</li><li>RYG</li><li>PRIORITY_HML</li><li>DECISION_SYMBOLS</li><li>DECISION_SHAPES</li><li>VCR</li><li>RYGB</li><li>RYGG</li><li>WEATHER</li><li>PROGRESS</li><li>ARROWS_3_WAY</li><li>ARROWS_4_WAY</li><li>ARROWS_5_WAY</li><li>DIRECTIONS_3_WAY</li><li>DIRECTIONS_4_WAY</li><li>SKI</li><li>SIGNAL</li><li>STAR_RATING</li><li>HEARTS</li><li>MONEY</li><li>EFFORT</li><li>PAIN</li></ul>" %>

<%= PICKLIST_SYMBOL_LIST %>
 
<aside class="notice">The Smartsheet grid user interface presents several row attributes and features (e.g., row number, attachments, discussions, row action indicator, etc.) visually as columns.  The API does not consider these to be columns, and does not return or otherwise expose them as columns.  The only columns returned by the API are user data columns.</aside>

### System Columns

In addition to the standard column types and symbols, Smartsheet has a number of *system columns*, which represent data that is
filled in by Smartsheet and whose values cannot be changed by the user. These columns are represented with standard
[column types](#column-types), with the **[Column.systemColumnType](#column-object)** attribute set to one of the following:

Column.systemColumnType Value | Column Type | Notes
-----|-----|-----|
MODIFIED_DATE | DATETIME
MODIFIED_BY | CONTACT_LIST
CREATED_DATE | DATETIME
CREATED_BY  | CONTACT_LIST
AUTO_NUMBER | TEXT_NUMBER | Columns of this system column type will include an [AutoNumberFormat object](#autonumberformat-object) that describes the mask used to generate the value.

## Cell Values

Within the Smartsheet web application, all editable column types are flexible and cells in those columns can contain either
a value specific to the column type (e.g. dates, checkboxes, symbols, etc.) or a free-form text value.  This allows for a very
flexible UI and is one of the key benefits to using Smartsheet.

<aside class="notice">See the <a href="#column-types">Column Types</a> section for information on the different column types.</aside>

### Cell Value Representation

[Cell objects](#cell-object) retrieved through the Smartsheet API's have two attributes representing cell values: **Cell.value**, and
**Cell.displayValue**.  An empty cell is always represented by **null** for both.

**Cell.displayValue** is always a **string** and is only returned for certain column types (see below).  It represents the formatted value as it should
be displayed to an end-user.  For example, if a TEXT_NUMBER column is formatted as a US Dollar currency, its **value** may be a number
like 1234.5678, but its **displayValue** would be "$1,234.57".

**Cell.value** represents a cell's raw value and can be one of the following primitive JSON types: **string**, **number**, or **boolean**,
depending on the column type.  Complex types are represented as strings, formatted as described below:

<% PROJECT_COLUMN_HELP_URL = "http://help.smartsheet.com/customer/portal/articles/765737-project-sheet-columns-start-date-end-date-duration-complete-and-predecessors" %>

| Column Type | Possible Types for Cell.value | Returns Cell.displayValue?
|-------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------
| TEXT_NUMBER	| **string**: free-form text values<br/>**number**: numeric values											| Yes: same as **value** for strings; for number values, the number with formatting applied.
| CONTACT_LIST	| **string**: an email address representing a contact, or a free-form text value.							| Yes: same as **value** for free-form strings; for contacts, the contact's name if any, else their email address.
| DATE			| **string**: a date in [ISO-8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format, or a free-form text value.<br/>**number**: see [Dates and Times](#dates-and-times) for how to request dates to be returned as numbers. | No.
| PICKLIST		| **string**: one of the picklist's column options, or a free-form text value.<br/>**number**: numeric values| Yes: same as **value** for strings; for number values, the number with formatting applied.
| CHECKBOX		| **boolean**: `true` if the checkbox is checked, `false` otherwise.<br/>**string**: a free-form text value.| No.
| DURATION		| **string**: a duration value such as "4d 6h 30m" in the user's locale, or a free-form text value.<br/>See the [Help Center](<%= PROJECT_COLUMN_HELP_URL %>) for more information on durations.| Yes: same as **value**
| PREDECESSOR	| **string**: a comma-delimited predecessor list such as "12FS +3d 4h, 14SS", or a free-form text value.<br/>See the [Help Center](<%= PROJECT_COLUMN_HELP_URL %>) for more information on predecessors.| Yes: same as **value**
| ABSTRACT_DATETIME | **string**: a project date and time in [ISO-8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format, or a free-form text value.<br/>**number**: see [Dates and Times](#dates-and-times) for how to request dates to be returned as numbers. | No.

### Cell Value Parsing

The flexibility in cell value data types is a powerful feature in the Smartsheet application, but at the same time, it poses a challenge
for an API in terms of parsing. Being too flexible will likely result in unexpected behavior. For instance, if you write code
to post a Date value to a Smartsheet and the API operation succeeds,  you might assume that the date value you sent was interpreted
as date. What happens if you posted your date in the wrong format? Do you really want Smartsheet to keep the malformed date
as a Text value? Probably not.
 
To address this problem, the Smartsheet API employs a simple scheme to indicate whether you want a more predictable and strict
interface or a more flexible one. By default, a cell value is expected to conform to "strict" rules for the type of the cell's column.
If an input value doesn't conform, the API will return [error code 1042](#errors).

If, however, you want the same flexibility as the Smartsheet web application, you can disable the strict rules, and we’ll do our best to make
sense of it. To enable lenient parsing simply include `"strict" : false` in the [Cell object](#cell-object) in your request body.

The parsing rules for the various column types are as follows:

**TEXT_NUMBER**:

     |     |
-----|-----|
*Strict* | All numeric and text values are valid and are interpreted literally.
*Lenient* | All numeric and text values are valid. Formatted numbers passed as text values, such as currencies ("$5,000"), percentages ("50%"), or decimals ("100.5")  will be parsed to their numeric equivalents, based on the locale of the Access Token owner,  with the proper formatting enabled for the cell.

**PICKLIST**:

     |     |
-----|-----|
*Strict* | The value must be a string and must be one of the options for the Picklist.
*Lenient* | All numeric and text values are valid. Formatted numbers will be parsed like TEXT_NUMBER formatted numbers.

**DATE**:

     |     |
-----|-----|
*Strict* | The value must be a string value and a valid ISO 8601 date (YYYY-MM-DD).
*Lenient* | We will attempt to convert the string value to date using ISO 8601 date format, as well as several locale-specific date formats. If the value is a parsable date format, we will recognize the date and store it as such. All other values are simply text values.

<aside class="notice">You may use the query string parameter <b>numericDates</b> with a value of <code>true</code> to enable strict parsing of dates in numeric format.  See <a href="#dates-and-times">Dates and Times</a> for more information.</aside>

**CONTACT_LIST**:

     |     |
-----|-----|
*Strict* | The value must be a valid email address. If "displayValue" is set, we use that as the name, otherwise if we find a match among the the Access Token owner's contacts, we will associate this cell with that existing contact.
*Lenient* | If the value is a valid email address, we handle it the same way as Strict. If not, we save the value as a text value.

<aside class="notice">See <a href="#contact-list-columns">Contact List Columns</a> for more information.</aside>

**CHECKBOX**:

     |     |
-----|-----|
*Strict* | Only boolean values (true or false) are valid.
*Lenient* | Boolean values and string values of "true" and "false" are handled the same as Strict. All other values are saved as text values.

**DURATION**:

     |     |
-----|-----|
*Strict* | Only valid duration strings in the user's locale are valid.  Information on duration strings can be found in the [Help Center](<%= PROJECT_COLUMN_HELP_URL %>).
*Lenient* | Numeric values are treated as duration values in days.  String values which are valid duration strings in the user's locale are treated as durations, and any other values are treated as free-form text values.

<aside class="notice">You may use the query string parameter <b>projectParseLocale</b> with a <a href="#server-information">supported locale string</a> to force parsing in the specified locale (e.g. using <code>en_US</code> will let you send in English values regardless of the user's locale)</aside>

**PREDECESSOR**:

     |     |
-----|-----|
*Strict* | Only valid predecessor strings in the user's locale are valid. Information on predecessor strings can be found in the [Help Center](<%= PROJECT_COLUMN_HELP_URL %>).
*Lenient* | String values which are valid predecessor strings in the user's locale are treated as predecessors, and any other values are treated as free-form text values.

<aside class="notice">You may use the query string parameter <b>projectParseLocale</b> with a <a href="#server-information">supported locale string</a> to force parsing in the specified locale (e.g. using <code>en_US</code> will let you send in English values regardless of the user's locale)</aside>

**ABSTRACT_DATETIME**:

     |     |
-----|-----|
*Strict* | The value must be a string value and a valid ISO 8601 date and time.
*Lenient* | We will attempt to convert the string value to date using ISO 8601 date format, as well as several locale-specific date formats. If the value is a parsable date format, we will recognize the date and store it as such. All other values are simply text values.

<aside class="notice">You may use the query string parameter <b>numericDates</b> with a value of <code>true</code> to enable strict parsing of dates in numeric format.  See <a href="#dates-and-times">Dates and Times</a> for more information.</aside>

#### Contact List Columns

With columns of type CONTACT_LIST, cells’ “value” and “displayValue” attributes are treated independently. 
The contact’s email address is represented by **value**, while the contact’s name (and the value displayed in the cell in the Smartsheet app) is represented by **displayValue**.
 
When creating or updating cells for a contact list column, the **displayValue** attribute works as follows:
<ul>
<li>If **displayValue** is non-null and non-empty, the Smartsheet cell will display the value provided.</li>
<li>If **displayValue** is an empty string, the Smartsheet cell will display the email address.</li>
<li>If **displayValue** is null or absent, Smartsheet will make a best guess effort at filling it in with a contact’s name based on the email address.</li>
</ul>

## Paging

The Smartsheet API contains a number of *index endpoints* (typically denoted in the documentation with titles beginning with "Get All..." or "List...") which return arrays of objects.
Examples include `GET` [/users](#list-users), [/sheets](#list-sheets), [/sheets/{sheetId}/columns](#get-all-columns), and many others.  These endpoints all support pagination, meaning
you can retrieve paged subsets of results, enabling you to process potentially large result sets in smaller chunks.

### Paging Query String Parameters
Index endpoints all support pagination via the following optional query string parameters:

     |     |     |
-----|-----|-----|
**pageSize** 	| number  | The maximum number of items to return per page.  Unless otherwise stated for a specific endpoint, defaults to **100** if not specified.
**page**		| number  | Which page to return.  Defaults to **1** if not specified.
**includeAll**  | boolean | If true, include all results (i.e. do not paginate).  Mutually exclusive with **pageSize** and **page** (they are ignored if **includeAll**=true is specified).

<aside class="notice">Most index endpoints default to a page size of 100 results.  If you need all results at once, you should specify the <code class="prettyprint">includeAll=true</code> query string parameter.</aside>

### Paged Responses

Index endpoints all return paged responses via an **IndexResult** object which provides paging metadata that can be used to navigate the full set of pages in the result set:

<%= partial "snippets/indexResult_object.md.erb" %>

## Bulk-insert Operations

Several endpoints support optional bulk `POST` operations which exist alongside the standard single-object `POST`.  For these endpoints, you may pass in either a single object, or an array of objects.
Depending on what was passed in, the [Result object](#result-object) returned will contain either a single object, or an array.  An example optional bulk operation is [POST /favorites](#add-favorite(s)): you can
pass in a single [Favorite object](#favorite-object) to create a single favorite, or an array of Favorite objects to create multiple favorites in a single request.  Endpoints which support bulk operations will be
noted as such in their API reference documentation.

**NOTE**: Several `POST` operations fail when attempting to create a single object which already exists (e.g. favorites, shares, group members).  However, for the corresponding bulk operations, these endpoints will *not*
return an error if one or more items in the array already exist.  Existing items will simply be ignored, and [Result object](#result-object) returned will omit them.

<aside class="notice">As we make future updates to the API, we may add bulk support to additional endpoints.  Because the endpoints will continue to support single-object semantics, this will not result in a breaking change,
and existing code will continue to function.</aside>

## Dates and Times

The Smartsheet API returns all dates and times in the [UTC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) time zone, in [ISO-8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format.  If a date/time needs to be
displayed to an end-user in their local time zone, you will need to do the conversion using the user's time zone which you can obtain by [getting the current user](#get-current-user).

You can optionally choose to receive and input dates/times in numeric format, as milliseconds since the UNIX epoch (midnight on January 1, 1970 in UTC time), using the query string parameter **numericDates** with a value of `true`.
This flag works for any API request.

# Getting Started

## Developer Account

Developer accounts provide access to the full range of features and functionality available in production. 
They are easy to set up, will not expire, and will let you focus on your development without any risk to your production data.
 
To set up a Developer account, please visit the Smartsheet Developer Portal [registration page](http://www.smartsheet.com/developers/register). 
If you already have a paid Smartsheet account and your goal is to keep your development and production accounts separate, make sure to use a different email address when registering.
 
Please note that Developer accounts are intended for development and testing purposes only, and are subject to the [Smartsheet Developer Program Agreement](https://www.smartsheet.com/files/SmartsheetDeveloperProgramAgreement20150630.pdf).

## SDKs and Sample Code

See our [Github repository](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform) for sample / source code in multiple languages and our [tools and sample apps page ](http://www.smartsheet.com/apps)for sample apps.  
 
See our [SDK page](http://www.smartsheet.com/developers/sdks) for available SDKs or to submit your vote for additional language coverage.

## Direct API Access

Smartsheet makes it easy to directly access your data via the API. 
The first step is to generate an Access Token via the Smartsheet UI. 
Users can generate and have more than one active token at any time. 
Access Tokens generated in Smartsheet UI are long lived, meaning they won’t expire for 10 years. 
They are best used in system-level integrations, such as applications designed to keep Smartsheet and other systems in sync, or to integrate with Zapier, ifttt or similar API integration services.

### Generating Access Token

These instructions assume that you already have an existing Smartsheet account. Follow these steps to generate an Access Token:
<ol>
<li>Click the **Account** button in the upper-left corner of your Smartsheet screen and select **Personal Settings**.  This will open the Personal Settings form.</li>
<li>Click the **API Access** button to open the API Access form.
<li>Use the API Access form to generate new or manage existing acces tokens.
</ol>
 
Because you can generate and have more than one active token at any time, you have the ability to implement a granular security policy by designating a separate token for each application or integration scenario you may have. 
That way, should any one token become compromised, you can easily revoke it without impacting any of your other API-enabled applications.
 
<aside class="notice">You will have only one opportunity to view and copy your newly generated token. For security reasons, you will not be able to retrieve it at a later time. If you lose your token, however, it is easy to use the UI to revoke it and generate a new one.</aside>
 
<aside class="success">Access Tokens are essentially passwords and grant the holder access to all of your Smartsheet data. It is imperative that you keep them secure.</aside>

### Using Access Tokens

> Example Request:

```shell
curl https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/users/me \
`-H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

> Example Response:

```json
{
    "email": "john.doe@smartsheet.com",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "id": 48569348493401200
}
```

Once you have an Access Token, include it in the **Authorization** header for every request you make:

`Authorization: Bearer 0da6cf0d848266b4cd32a6151b1`

The header name is <b>Authorization</b> and the value of the header is <b>Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN</b>, where ACCESS_TOKEN is a token generated by you. Since the access token is being transmitted in clear text, all API calls are done over HTTPS.

## Third Party App Development

In addition to being a powerful work management tool, Smartsheet is a powerful application platform. 
We are committed to making it easy to build applications on top of Smartsheet - whether you are developing a solution for your organization or creating an app for the Smartsheet customer community at large. 
We are here to support you and would love your feedback on how to improve the API and the developer experience.
 
As a developer, you may be building applications that allow any Smartsheet user to access his or her Smartsheet data. 
Doing so requires that you complete the following steps.

1. [Complete your Developer Profile](#developer-registration) 
2. [Register your App](#registering-your-app)
3. Within your app, [implement a 3-legged oAuth flow](#oauth-flow) to obtain an access token that can be used to access Smartsheet data on behalf of an end user. 
 
### Developer Registration

Third party app registration and management is available via the Developer Tools. 
To get access to Developer Tools, you must first [register](http://www.smartsheet.com/developers/register) as a Smartsheet developer. 
Follow the instructions on the registration form to add Developer Tools to an existing Smartsheet account or create a new Smartsheet developer account.
 
Once you complete the developer registration, log in to Smartsheet to access Developer Tools.  
<ol>
<li>Click the **Account** button in the upper-left corner of your Smartsheet screen.</li>
<li>Now that you are registered as a Smartsheet developer, you should see a new **Developer Tools** option in the dropdown menu. Select it to open Developer Tools.</li>
<li>Before you can register your first app, you will need to complete your developer profile. Developer profile is a public profile that anyone can access to learn more about you and your applications.</li>
<li>Once your developer profile is complete, you will be able to use **Developer Tools** to register and manage your apps.</li>
</ol>

### Registering Your App

To build a third party app, you must first register it with Smartsheet using Developer Tools:
<ol>
<li>Login to Smartsheet.</li>
<li>Click the **Account** button in the upper-left corner of your Smartsheet screen and select **Developer Tools**.</li>
<li>Create new app and provide the required information, including name, description, contact info and a redirect URL. Redirect URL (also known as the "callback URL") is the URL in your app where Smartsheet must redirect after authentication is complete.</li>
<li>Use the generated app **client id** and **secret** to connect your app to Smartsheet. See [oAuth Flow](#oauth-flow) for details on how to use **client id** and **secret** to do that.</li>
</ol>

### Access Scopes

In order to access an end user's Smartsheet data, your application must explicitly ask for specific Access Scopes. 
The Access Scopes enable your app to communicate to the end users what type of operations it will be performing. 
Access Scopes do not override existing Access Level restrictions. 
For example, having the Access Scope of WRITE_SHEETS will not allow your app to update a sheet on which the end user has read-only permission.
 
The Access Scopes are as follows:

     |     |
-----|-----|
READ_SHEETS | Read all sheet data, including comments, attachments and cell data
WRITE_SHEETS | Insert and modify sheet data, including comments, attachments and cell data
SHARE_SHEETS | Share sheets, including sending sheets as attachments
DELETE_SHEETS | Delete sheets
CREATE_SHEETS | Create new sheets  
READ_USERS | Retrieve users and groups for your Smartsheet organization
ADMIN_USERS | Add and remove users from your Smartsheet organization; create groups and manage membership
ADMIN_SHEETS | Modify sheet structure, including column definition, publish state, etc.
ADMIN_WORKSPACES | Create and manage workspaces and folders, including sharing
 
<aside class="notice">Third-party apps should only request the scopes necessary. User-generated Access Tokens are granted all of these permissions.</aside>

### oAuth Flow

Your app must implement a 3-legged oAuth flow to retrieve an access token that can be used to access Smartsheet data on behalf of an end user. 
This process involves the following steps:

1. [Request authorization from the user](#requesting-authorization-from-the-user)
2. [Obtain the authorization code](#obtaining-the-authorization-code)
3. [Use the authorization code to obtain an access token](#obtaining-an-access-token)
4. [Refresh the access token](#refreshing-an-access-token) (as necessary)

#### Requesting authorization from the user

To request authorization from an end user, direct your user to `https://www.smartsheet.com/b/authorize` with the following parameters through either a `GET` or `POST`. The parameter values must be URL-encoded:

     |     |
-----|-----|
response_type<br/>(required) | must be set to "code"
client_id<br/>(required) | client id for your app
redirect_uri<br/>(optional) | redirect URL you [registered](#registering-your-app) for your app (including protocol, e.g. "http://"); if not provided, the redirect URL set during registration is used
scope<br/>(required) | space-delimited list of [access scopes](#access-scopes) to which you are asking the user to grant access (note the spaces must be URL-encoded as "%20")
state | arbitrary string that will be returned to your app; intended to be used by you to ensure that this redirect is indeed from an OAuth flow that you initiated

Here is an example of a URL to which you would send your user as a `GET` request:
 
`https://www.smartsheet.com/b/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=dheu3dmkd32fhxme&scope=READ_SHEETS%20WRITE_SHEETS&state=MY_STATE`
 
If your user has not logged in to Smartsheet, he/she will first be directed to the Smartsheet login page. 
After a successful login, your user will be prompted to allow or deny the access scopes you requested.

#### Obtaining the authorization code

If the user clicks “Allow”, he/she will be redirected to the **redirect_uri** with the following parameters:

     |     |
-----|-----|
code | authorization code required to obtain access token
expires_in | number of seconds code is valid once issued; this is always 4 minutes - you must obtain an access token within that time
state | **state** string specified earlier

If the user clicks “Deny”, he/she will be redirected to the **redirect_uri** with the following parameters:

     |     |
-----|-----|
error | "access_denied"
state | **state** string specified earlier

Other errors that may be returned include:

     |     |
-----|-----|
unsupported_response_type | response_type must be set to “code”
invalid_scope | one or more of the requested access scopes are invalid. Please check the list of access scopes

#### Obtaining an access token

> Request an access token:

```shell
curl https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/token \
-d 'grant_type=authorization_code&code={your_code}&client_id={your_client_id}&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}&hash={SHA_256(client_secret|code)}' \
-X POST
```

> Successful Response:

```json
{
   "access_token": "Access Token Value",
   "token_type": "bearer",
   "refresh_token": "Refresh Token Value",
   "expires_in": "# of seconds before token expires"
}
```

> Error Response:

```json
{
   "errorCode": "Smartsheet error number",
   "error": "OAuth error type",
   "error_description": "Error description"
}
```

Once you’ve successfully obtained an authorization code, the next step is to obtain an access token. 
To do so, you’ll need to make a `POST` request to `https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/token` with the following parameters:

     |     |
-----|-----|
grant_type<br/>(required) | must be set to "authorization_code"
client_id<br/>(required) | client id for your app
code<br/>(required) | authorization code returned in the [previous step](#obtaining-the-authorization-code)
redirect_uri<br/>(optional) | redirect URL [registered](#registering-your-app) for your app, including the protocol (e.g., "http://"); if not provided, the redirect URL set during registration is used
hash<br/>(required) | SHA-256 hash of your client secret concatenated with a pipe and the authorization code.  The **client_secret** is never sent with the request.

<aside class="notice">The "Get Token" request must have the <b>Content-Type</b> header set to 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'.</aside>

Possible OAuth error types:

     |     |
-----|-----|
invalid_request | The request parameters are invalid or missing.
invalid_client | The client information is invalid. Ensure your client id is correct.
invalid_grant | The authorization code or refresh token is invalid or expired, the redirect_uri does not match, or the hash value does not match the client secret and/or code.
unsupported_grant_type | grant_type must equal “authorization_code” or “refresh_token”.

#### Refreshing an access token

> Refresh an access token:

```shell
curl https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/token \
-d 'grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token={your_refresh_token}&client_id={your_client_id}&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}&hash={SHA_256(client_secret|refresh_token)}' \
-X POST
```

> Successful Response:

```json
{
   "access_token": "Newly refreshed Access Token",
   "expires_in": "# of seconds before token expires",
   "token_type": "bearer",
   "refresh_token": "New refresh token"
}
```

An access token is valid for one week but you can use the refresh token to obtain a new access token. 
Once you obtain the new access token, you can use it in place of the old one, which is no longer valid.
 
To do so, you’ll need to make a `POST` request to `https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/token` with the following parameters:

     |     |
-----|-----|
grant_type<br/>(required)| must be set to "refresh_token"
client_id<br/>(required)| client id for your app
refresh_token<br/>(required)| refresh_token value that came with the access token
redirect_uri<br/>(optional)| redirect URL [registered](#registering-your-app) for your app, including the protocol (e.g., "http://")
hash<br/>(required)| SHA-256 hash of your client secret concatenated with a pipe and the refresh token value

<aside class="notice">The "Refresh Token" request must have the <b>Content-Type</b> header set to 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'.</aside>

##### Getting basic user info
Once you have obtained an access token on behalf of the user, you can fetch basic information (including user ID, name, etc.) about the caller using the [Get Current User](#get-current-user) operation.

# Admin Features

Smartsheet users with System Admin rights have access to additional API features, including user management and ability to access any sheet in the organization.

## Manage Users

As an org Administrator, you can provision, de-provision and otherwise manage users in your Smartsheet organization.  See [Users](#users) for more information on relevant API calls.

## Assume-User

As an org Administrator, you can assume the identity of any user in your organization. 
This advanced feature enables a number of useful business scenarios, such as executing an organization-wide backup or maintaining data attribution when integrating with another system.
 
Here is how it works. 
Simply add an **Assume-User** header to your call, with the URI-encoded email address of the user whose identity you want to assume as the value. 
For example, if you want to assume the identity of **john.doe@smartsheet.com** and john.doe@smartsheet.com is a confirmed member of your Smartsheet organization, you would add the following header:

`Assume-User: john.doe%40smartsheet.com`

You can then act on behalf of the user and make API calls as though you were that user.

## Maintain Data Attribution

> Example Request:

```shell
curl https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/{sheetId}/rows \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN" \
-H "Assume-User: bob.johnson%40smartsheet.com" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-X POST \
-d '{"toTop":true", "rows":[{"cells": [ {"columnId": 3738748463671172, "value": "Revision 1"}, {"columnId": 5427598323935108, "value": "New status", "strict": false} ]} ]}'
```

If you are integrating Smartsheet with another API-enabled system, such as Salesforce, it may be useful to maintain attribution when adding data to Smartsheet. 
For example, let's say you want to add a new row to a Sales Pipeline sheet in Smartsheet whenever your sales team updates a sales pipeline in Salesforce. 
So, if Bob Johnson makes a change in Salesforce, wouldn't it be great to make the new row show up in Smartsheet as if it were created by Bob? 
Specifying the **Assume-User** header API requests allows org Administrators to develop integrations which do just that.
 
## List All Sheets

As an org Administrator, you can get a list of all sheets in your organization, regardless of ownership or whether or not the sheets have been shared to you. 
Please see [List All Org Sheets](#list-all-org-sheets) for more information.

## Backup All Org Data

> Get list of all sheets in the org:

```shell
curl https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/users/sheets \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

> Fetch each sheet (using Assume-User):

```shell
curl https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/{sheetId}?include=discussions,attachments \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN" \
-H "Assume-User: OWNER_EMAIL"
```

> Fetch each attachment:

```shell
curl -0 URL_TO_ATTACHMENT
```

To backup all of the org data, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Get a list of all sheets in your organization.</li>
<li>For each sheet in the list, fetch the sheet (optionally including a list of discussions and attachments) by assuming the identity of the owner of the sheet. (The value of the **Assume-User** header must be the URI-encoded email address of the sheet owner.)</li>
<li>To backup all files attached to each sheet, fetch them one at a time, using your favorite download method. See [Get Attachment](#get-attachment) for more information.
</ol>

You can use the sheet version number to enable incremental backups. [Fetch the sheet version number](#get-sheet-version) and compare it to the last backed up version number (you will need to store the sheet ID and the last backup up version number) - if they are the same, no need to include the sheet in your incremental backup run.

# <span class="customTOCSectionHeading">API Reference</span>

# Attachments

Attachments can exist on a [Comment](#comments) (i.e., within a Discussion), on a [Row](#rows), or on a [Sheet](#sheets).

## <%= OBJECTS %>

### Attachment Object

## Posting an Attachment

Like the Smartsheet web application, the Smartsheet API allows uploading files to Sheets, Rows and Comments. 
You can upload a file by performing either a *simple upload* or a *multipart upload*. 

A [simple upload](#simple-uploads) allows you to add a single file attachment to the specified object. 
For example, you can perform a simple upload to upload a file to a [sheet](#attach-file-to-sheet), [row](#attach-file-to-row), or [comment](#attach-file-to-comment). 

A [multipart upload](#multipart-uploads) allows you to add a single file attachment to the specified object (i.e., attach a file to a [sheet](#attach-file-to-sheet), [row](#attach-file-to-row), or [comment](#attach-file-to-comment)), or to create an object and attach a file using a single request. 
For example, you can perform a multipart upload to [create a new Comment](#add-comment) that contains a single file attachment or to [add a new Discussion to a Sheet](#create-discussion-on-sheet) that contains a single file attachment.

<aside class="notice">Important Notes:<ul><li>Max file size for uploads through the API is currently limited to 30mb.</li><li>Posting an attachment is a resource-intensive operation and incurs 10 additional requests against the rate limit.</li></ul></aside>

### Multipart Uploads

A multipart upload request allows you to add a single file attachment to the specified object (i.e., attach a file to a [sheet](#attach-file-to-sheet), [row](#attach-file-to-row), or [comment](#attach-file-to-comment)), or to create an object and upload a file using a single request. 
For example, you can perform a multipart upload to [create a new Comment](#add-comment) that contains a single file attachment or to [add a new Discussion to a Sheet](#create-discussion-on-sheet) that contains a single file attachment.

<aside class="notice">Most programming languages have libraries that can be used to assemble multipart requests.</aside>

A multipart upload request must include the following HTTP headers:

     |     |
-----|-----|
**Content-Type** | Must be set to `multipart/form-data`, and include the boundary string that will separate the parts in the request payload.
**Content-Length** | The length of the request payload.

The request body of a multipart upload request contains one or more *parts*, each part containing either JSON or a file to upload. 
The request body must contain at least one part. 
Each part must start with the boundary string specified in the **Content-Type** request header, and must contain the following part headers:

     |     |
-----|-----|
**Content-Disposition** | Contains the following semicolon-delimited items:<ul><li>`form-data`</li><li>`name=`"*part name*"</li><li>`filename=`"*filename*" (only required for file parts)</li></ul>
**Content-Type** | The content type of the part: `application/json` for JSON objects, or the applicable MIME type for file parts

The last part in the request must be followed by the boundary string, followed by two hyphens.

The documentation for each operation that supports multipart uploads will specify the number and names of parts that are expected for the operation. 
File parts must have the part name "file", and documentation for operations which allow for JSON object parts will specify the required part name for the JSON part.

The following example shows a multipart upload request that creates a Comment containing the specified text and file attachment:

`POST https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/4509093797881732/discussions/2889925487028100/comments`  
`Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN`  
`Content-Length: 29008`  
`Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----gU8h01zAAp3LagBr`  

`----gU8h01zAAp3LagBr`  
`Content-Disposition: form-data; name="comment"`  
`Content-Type: application/json`  

`{ "text": "Please review the attached image." }`  
`------gU8h01zAAp3LagBr`  
`Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="picture.jpg"`  
`Content-Type: image/jpeg`  

*< Binary content for file >*  
`------gU8h01zAAp3LagBr--`

### Simple Uploads

A [simple upload](#simple-uploads) allows you to add a single file attachment to the specified object. 
For example, you can perform a simple upload to upload a file to a [sheet](#attach-file-to-sheet), [row](#attach-file-to-row), or [comment](#attach-file-to-comment). 

To perform this kind of upload, you must set specific headers to tell Smartsheet about the file. The following three headers are required: 

     |     |
-----|-----|
**Content-Disposition** | `attachment` to tell the API that a file is in the body of the POST request, followed by a semicolon, followed by `filename=` and the filename in quotes
**Content-Type** | Can be left blank if it is not known (but must be present), and Smartsheet will make its best guess based on the extension of the file. 
**Content-Length** | Must be set to the size of the file, in bytes. For example to determine file size using in UNIX: <p>`$ ls -l ProgressReport.docx`<br/>`5463 ProgressReport.docx`</p>

The following example request shows a simple upload that adds a file attachment to a Sheet:

`POST https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/4509093797881732/attachments`  
`Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN`  
`Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="ProgressReport.docx"`  
`Content-Type: application/msword`  
`Content-Length: 5463`  

*< Binary content for file >*  

As shown in this example, the contents of the file is included in the body of the `POST` request. In most programming languages, this is done by reading the file from an input stream and writing it out to the output stream of the HTTP request.

To update the Cells in a Sheet, use the [Update Row(s)](#update-row(s)) operation.

## <%= RELATED %>

### Cell Links

You can create and modify [cell links](#celllink-object) by using any API operation that creates or updates cell data. 
Creating or updating cell links via the **cell.linkInFromCell** attribute is a special operation. 
A given row or cell update operation may contain only link updates, or no link updates. 
Attempting to mix row/cell updates with cell link updates will result in error code 1115.
 
When creating a cell link, **cell.value** must be null (the data will be pulled from the linked cell).
 
A cell may not contain both a hyperlink and a cell link, so **hyperlink** and **linkInFromCell** may never both be non-null at the same time.
 
A cell link can only be added to an *existing* cell, so the **cell.linkInFromCell** attribute is not allowed when POSTing a new row to a sheet.

### Hyperlinks

You can create and modify [hyperlinks](#hyperlink-object) by using any API operation that creates or updates cell data. 
When creating or updating a hyperlink, **cell.value** may be set to a string value or null. 
If null, the cell's value will be derived from the hyperlink: 
<ul><li>If the hyperlink is a URL link, the cell's value will be set to the URL itself.</li><li>If the hyperlink is a sheet or report link, the cell's value will be set to the sheet or report's name.</li></ul>

<%= SCOPE %> | READ_SHEETS
<%= HEADERS %> | <%= HEADER_AUTH %>
<%= PARAMETERS %> | **include** (optional) -- when specified with a value of "source", response will include the [source](#source-object) for any sheet that was created from another sheet or template
<%= RETURNS %> | [Home object](#home-object), populated according to the **include** parameter

## <%= RELATED %>

### Home Folders

For details about working with Folders in the user's **Sheets** folder (i.e., at the Home level), see [Folders](#folders).

### Home Sheets

For details about working with sheets in the user's **Sheets** folder (i.e., at the Home level), see [Sheets](#sheets).

# Reports

A Report is a filtered view of the data from one or more Sheets. Like a Sheet, a Report is comprised of Columns, Rows, and Cells, and may optionally contain Attachments and/or Discussions.

## <%= OBJECTS %>

### Report Object

Extends the [Sheet object](#sheet-object), adding the following:

     |     |     |
-----|-----|-----|
**sourceSheets** | [Sheet](#sheet-object)[] | Array of Sheet objects (without rows), representing the sheets that rows in the report originated from.  Only included in the [Get Report](#get-report) response if the **include** parameter specifies "sourceSheets".

### Report Cell Object

Extends the [Cell object](#cell-object), adding the following: 

     |     |     |
-----|-----|-----|
**virtualColumnId** | number | The virtual ID of the cell's column. This property refers to the cell's parent column in the Report, while the **columnId** property refers to the cell's parent column in its originating source Sheet.


### Report Column Object

Extends the [Column object](#column-object), adding the following: 

     |     |     |
-----|-----|-----|
**virtualId** | number | The virtual ID of this report column
**sheetNameColumn** | boolean | Returned only for the special "Sheet Name" report column (value = "true")

A report column is a "virtual" column, in that it appears identical to source sheet column(s), but is in fact a different column belonging to the report. 
[Cells](#report-cell-object) in the report refer to this column via their **virtualColumnId** attribute, and to their actual column from their source sheet via their **columnId** attribute.

### Report Row Object

Extends the [Row object](#row-object), adding the following: 

     |     |     |
-----|-----|-----|
**sheetId** | number | The ID of the Sheet from which the Row originates

# Token

The Smartsheet API utilizes OAuth 2.0 for Authentication and Authorization. An **Authorization** HTTP header containing an Access Token is required to authenticate requests.  For more information, see [Authentication](#authentication).

## Get Access Token

> Example Request:

```shell
curl https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/token \
-d 'grant_type=authorization_code&code={your_code}&client_id={your_client_id}&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}&hash={SHA_256(client_secret|code)}' \
-X POST
```

> Example Response:

```json
{
   "access_token": "Access Token Value",
   "token_type": "bearer",
   "refresh_token": "Refresh Token Value",
   "expires_in": "#_of_seconds_before_token_expires"
}
```

`POST /token`

Gets an access token, as part of the oAuth process. For more information, see [oAuth Flow](#oauth-flow).

     |     |
-----|-----|
<%= PARAMETERS %> | **grant_type** (required) -- must be set to "authorization_code"
 | **client_id** (required) -- client id for your app
 | **code** (required) -- authorization code returned in the previous step
 | **redirect_uri** (required) -- redirect URL registered for your app, including the protocol (e.g., "http://"); if not provided, the redirect URL set during registration is used.
 | **hash** (required) -- SHA-256 hash of your client secret concatenated with a pipe and the authorization code.  The client_secret is never sent with the request.

## Refresh Access Token

> Example Request:

```shell
curl https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/token \
-d 'grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token={your_refresh_token}
&client_id={your_client_id}&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}
&hash={SHA_256(client_secret|refresh_token)}' \
-X POST
```

> Example Response:

```json
{
   "access_token": "Newly refreshed Access Token",
   "expires_in": "#_of_seconds_before_token_expires",
   "token_type": "bearer",
   "refresh_token": "New refresh token"
}
```

`POST /token`

Refreshes an access token, as part of the oAuth process. For more information, see [oAuth Flow](#oauth-flow).

     |     |
-----|-----|
<%= PARAMETERS %> | **grant_type** (required) -- must be set to "refresh_token"
 | **client_id** (required) -- client id for your app
 | **refresh_token** (required) -- refresh_token value that came with the access token
 | **redirect_uri** (required) -- redirect URL registered for your app, including the protocol (e.g., "http://")
 | **hash** (required) -- SHA-256 hash of your client secret concatenated with a pipe and the refresh token value

## Revoke Access Token

> Example Request:

```shell
curl https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/token \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN" \
-X DELETE
```

> Example Response:

```json
{
    "message": "SUCCESS",
    "resultCode": 0
}
```

`DELETE /token`

Revokes the access token used to make this request.  The access token will no longer be valid, and subsequent API calls made using the token will fail.

## AutoNumberFormat Object

Object that describes how the the System Column type of "AUTO_NUMBER" is auto-generated.

     |     |     |
-----|-----|-----|
**prefix** | string | The prefix. Can include the date tokens:<ul><li>{YY}</li><li>{YYYY}</li><li>{MM}</li><li>{DD}</li></ul>
**suffix** | string | The suffix. Can include the date tokens:<ul><li>{YY}</li><li>{YYYY}</li><li>{MM}</li><li>{DD}</li></ul>
**fill** | string | Indicates zero-padding. Must be between 0 and 10 "0" (zero) characters.
**startingNumber** | number | The starting number for the auto-id
 
## IndexResult Object

Object returned for all `GET` operations against index endpoints.  This object provides metadata which can be used to perform paging on potentially large data sets.  See the [Paging](#paging) section for more information.

<%= partial "snippets/indexResult_object.md.erb" %>

## Result Object

Object returned for all `PUT` operations and `POST` operations (and for some other operations). 

     |     |     |
-----|-----|-----|
**resultCode** | number | 0 (zero) if successful
**message** | string | Message that indicates the outcome of the request
**result** | Object | Object that was created or updated (if applicable)
**version** | number | New version of the Sheet (only available on select operations)

# Formatting

Formatting data can optionally be included for columns, rows, and cells by adding the "include=format" query string parameter to any API operation that returns any of those objects (for example, `GET /sheets/{sheetId}`, `GET sheets/{sheetId}/rows/{rowId}`, etc.).  When this parameter is included, objects that contain non-default formatting will include a **format** property.  Objects which do not have any non-default format settings applied will exclude this property.
 
Because the amount of format data in a large sheet can potentially be very large in itself, for bandwidth reasons, format data is represented by a compact format descriptor string.  The format descriptor takes the form of a comma-separated list of numeric values.  These values represent indexes into pre-defined format lookup tables which can be retrieved using the `GET /serverinfo` operation.

## Row & Column Format

Setting the format of a row or column through the API simply sets the baseline format for new cells in that row or column.  It does not affect existing cells.
 
The equivalent API action for what happens when you highlight a column or row in the Smartsheet web app and set a format (e.g. bold) would be to update the format of a column or row (via `PUT /sheets/{sheetId}/rows/{rowId}` or `PUT /sheets/{sheetId}/columns/{columnId}`), and update the format for every cell in that row or column.  All of the cells in a row can be updated in one operation (`PUT /sheets/{sheetId}/rows/{rowId}`), but there is currently no way to update all of the cells in a column in one operation.  This will be addressed in a future version of the API.

## Format Descriptor

The format descriptor contains 16 comma-separated numeric indexes.  Each index represents a format style whose value can be found in one of the lookup tables in the [FormatTables object](#formattables-object).

**Format Descriptor Element #** | **Format Style** | **FormatTables Lookup Table Property** |
-----|-----|-----|
0 | Font Family | fontFamily
1 | Font size | fontSize
2 | Bold | bold
3 | Italic | italic
4 | Underline | underline
5 | Strikethrough | strikethrough
6 | Horizontal alignment | horizontalAlign
7 | Vertical alignment | verticalAlign
8 | Text color | color
9 | Background color | color
10 | Taskbar color | color
11 | Currency | currency
12 | Decimal count | decimalCount
13 | Thousands separator | thousandsSeparator
14 | Number format | numberFormat
15 | Text wrap | textWrap

<aside class="notice">Formats which have not been explicitly set are omitted in the descriptor string.  For example, a cell which has been set to bold and italic, but has no other formats applied to it, would have a format descriptor of ",,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,".</aside>

<aside class="notice">As a convenience, the FormatTables object contains a <b>defaults</b> property which is a format descriptor that describes which formats the Smartsheet web application displays for unset formats.  Your application can use these values to display unformatted cells identically to the Smartsheet web application.</aside>

## FormatTables Object

The FormatTables object is retrieved via the `GET /serverinfo` operation and contains all of the lookup tables that the [Format Descriptor](#format-descriptor) indexes refer to, as well as a property called **defaults**, which is a Format Descriptor that describes which formats the Smartsheet web application displays for unset formats.
 
<aside class="notice">Indexes and their values are guaranteed never to change or be removed for a given major API version.  However, new values could potentially be added to the ends of lookup tables.<br/><br/>Because of this possibility, your code should handle the case where a cell might contain a format index value greater than the size of a lookup table your app has loaded.  Your application should check for that case and reload the format tables if necessary.</aside>

     |     |     |

**color** | array of strings | Color hex values. <br/><br/>Note: "none" is the default value for all colors.  Applications will need to handle this value and use app-defined colors (typically this is Black for text color and White for background color)
**currency** | array of [Currency objects](#currency-object) | Currency codes and symbols

# <span class="customTOCSectionHeading">Deprecations</span>

Smartsheet occasionally deprecates APIs to indicate that those APIs should no longer be used in active development. 
Deprecated APIs typically remain present and usable for a reasonable period of time following the release in which they were deprecated, but may be removed entirely from a future version of the API. 
You should never use deprecated APIs in new development, and if you have existing code that uses deprecated APIs, we recommend that you update that code as soon as possible. 

<aside class="notice">There are currently no deprecations for version 2.0 of the Smartsheet API.</aside>
