Smartsheet uses a combination of [HTTP status codes](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html) and custom error codes with a descriptive message in JSON-formatted error objects to give you a more complete picture of what has happened with your request.

HTTP<br/>status code | Meaning | To Retry or Not to Retry? |
-----|-----|-----|-----|
2xx | Request was successful.<br/><br/>Example: 200 Success | --
4xx | A problem with request prevented it from executing successfully. | Never <i>automatically</i> retry the request.<br/><br/>If the error code indicates a problem that can be fixed, fix the problem and retry the request.
5xx | The request was properly formatted, but the operation failed on Smartsheet's end. | In some scenarios, requests should be automatically retried using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff" target="_blank">exponential backoff</a>.

For example, doing a `GET` on a non-existent sheet at `https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/123456` will result in an HTTP status code of **404**, indicating the resource was not found. 

{<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"errorCode": 1006,<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"message": "Not Found"<br/>
}

Some errors may contain a **detail** attribute set to an object with additional error details that may be useful in programmatically handling the error.  If so, it will be noted in the specific API operation for which the error may occur.
